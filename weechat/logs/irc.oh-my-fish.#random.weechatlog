2016-04-07 11:36:46	nwykes	@nwykes uploaded a file: Fish on Windows https://oh-my-fish.slack.com/files/nwykes/F0YRJTLSF/screen_shot_2016-04-07_at_12.35.09_pm.png  and commented: Need to work on the fonts.  But it’s a start.
2016-04-07 11:37:18	derekstavis	I don’t have any idea how fonts works on Linux on Windows
2016-04-07 11:38:04	derekstavis	on Linux and OS X you just 
2016-04-07 11:38:04	derekstavis	```omf install fonts
2016-04-07 11:38:04	derekstavis	fonts install —powerline Inconsolata
2016-04-07 11:38:04	derekstavis	```
2016-04-07 11:38:04	derekstavis	And use it on your terminal emulator
2016-04-07 11:42:45	nwykes	```⋊> /m/c/U/nwykes fonts install --powerline Inconsolata                                                          18:40:23

2016-04-07 11:42:45	nwykes	Try `wget --help' for more options.
2016-04-07 11:42:45	nwykes	Failed downloading font file```
2016-04-07 11:42:45	nwykes	Gonna be a lot of stuff like this to work through.  I’m just surprised that it all works.
2016-04-07 11:42:45	nwykes	Was able to add the fish apt-repository.  apt-get it.  do the curl install for omf.  omf install themes and packages, etc.
2016-04-07 11:42:45	nwykes	Never thought I’d see the day of this stuff running natively on windows outside cygwin or something similar.
