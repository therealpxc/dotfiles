2016-04-04 11:15:34	ng0	bad news. with my current traffic consumption, at least with one other project, it is hard to find an isp I could go to other than the one I am at now, so getting a guix mirror will happen when I can move my VMs to the first dedicated server with them.. which is anywhere from now to not specified point in the future.
2016-04-04 11:16:23	ng0	at that point it will possible not a mirror but a build machine if I can afford it.
2016-04-04 11:18:37	ng0	also, does someone know how I accidentally got an unremoveable mark stylized as "*" on a message in Gnus and how to remove it?
2016-04-04 11:20:03	mark_weaver	ng0: that means the message is "cached".  you probably typed "*".  to remove it, type M-*
2016-04-04 11:21:27	mark_weaver	see section 3.13 (Persistent Articles) of the Gnus manual
2016-04-04 11:21:43	ng0	that's harder to type than i thought with this keyboard
2016-04-04 11:22:25	mark_weaver	well, you need the shift key to get *, so on my US keyboard it's M-S-8
2016-04-04 11:23:02	ng0	i tried M * and it doesn't go away, but i'll try again

2016-04-04 11:24:05	mark_weaver	M * is different.  do you know the emacs way of describing key combinations?
2016-04-04 11:24:22	mark_weaver	M-* means hold down the Meta key (often labelled "Alt") while typing *
2016-04-04 11:24:38	mark_weaver	so, on a US or UK keyboard, that means to hold down both Meta and Shift while pressing 8
2016-04-04 11:24:41	ng0	no, apparently i don't know it yet ðŸ˜ƒ 
2016-04-04 11:24:57	ng0	now it's "A" .. hm
2016-04-04 11:25:46	mark_weaver	see section 2 (User Input) of the Emacs manual for more on how key combinations are described.

2016-04-04 11:27:53	davexunit	phant0mas: need to check
2016-04-04 11:28:06	mark_weaver	ng0: "A" means that you have "answered" that article, i.e. replied to it.  anyway, this is not the right channel for basic questions about Gnus.
2016-04-04 11:28:10	mark_weaver	maybe try #emacs or #gnus
2016-04-04 11:28:40	ng0	no, the marks are just wrong in this case. but you are right.

2016-04-04 11:56:37	davexunit	completely replaced the arguments field

2016-04-04 13:13:08	mark_weaver	rain1: iyzsong added gst-plugins-bad
2016-04-04 13:15:48	rain1	guix download httpsðŸ˜• /www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/MPlayer-1.3.0.tar.xz
2016-04-04 13:16:09	rain1	this seems to hang for me, which is odd because it downloaded fine from a browser
2016-04-04 13:16:11	efraim	1.3.0 has been out for a bit
2016-04-04 13:17:02	rain1	guix is still using 1.2.1
2016-04-04 13:17:15	rain1	i wonder if anyone uses mplayer though, given mpv
2016-04-04 13:19:01	rain1	seems troublesome
2016-04-04 13:19:09	rain1	what about removing mplayer?
2016-04-04 13:19:21	rain1	ah!
2016-04-04 13:19:24	rain1	that scared it into working

2016-04-04 13:31:29	phant0mas	davexunit: the only differences are that guix passes CONFIG_SHELL and SHELL and that the environment uses the profile

2016-04-04 13:35:35	rain1	I'm adding tips to my notes about: check reverse deps with guix refresh -l and to check hydra
2016-04-04 13:35:36	phant0mas	davexunit: they seem perfectly fine to me
2016-04-04 13:35:57	phant0mas	the problem is with avr-gcc
2016-04-04 13:36:12	davexunit	phant0mas: just sharing in case you wanted to hack anything ðŸ˜ƒ 
2016-04-04 13:36:46	phant0mas	there must be something that it doesn't get printed in the config.log
2016-04-04 13:36:53	phant0mas	davexunit: thank you ðŸ˜ƒ 
2016-04-04 13:38:19	davexunit	it's gotta be something silly
2016-04-04 13:38:28	davexunit	but it's baffling me.
2016-04-04 13:38:39	phant0mas	yes
2016-04-04 13:38:44	davexunit	'guix environment --container' is pretty damn close to what 'guix build' makes...
2016-04-04 13:43:27	ng0	oh. nvm the last question, there might just be no ./configure in the dir

2016-04-04 13:53:26	rain1	kyamashita, how did you get around that weird download link?
2016-04-04 13:53:27	kyamashita	But it depends on Debian's wmbattery source tarball.
2016-04-04 13:53:32	rain1	ahh..
2016-04-04 13:53:50	rain1	I was going to suggest yesterday: Why not just take that big repo and make a new repo for each subcomponent?
2016-04-04 13:53:54	lfam	I think we've had to do that a few times before
2016-04-04 13:54:01	lfam	Use Debian as a source, that is
2016-04-04 13:54:03	kyamashita	I contacted them and that was the solution that they said Debian and Gentoo had come up with.

2016-04-04 13:56:10	ng0	rain1: can you patch the Makefile or any occurence of /bin/cp ?
2016-04-04 13:56:28	davexunit	kyamashita: we have at least one other instance of using a source tarball from Debian
2016-04-04 13:56:32	davexunit	it may be OK
2016-04-04 13:56:36	rain1	I'll try that
2016-04-04 13:57:00	ng0	something like (/bin/cp) (which "cp") or something

2016-04-04 14:29:27	rain1	I'm having runpath problems when trying to create a package
2016-04-04 14:29:58	rain1	it's the bootstrap binary for the mlton SML compiler
2016-04-04 14:30:20	rain1	it wants libgmp but i give it that as an input and RUNPATH fails at the end
2016-04-04 14:30:44	rain1	would it be wrong to turn off validate-runpath?
2016-04-04 14:31:12	rain1	the only purpose of the package is to build mlton from source
2016-04-04 14:33:19	civodul`	validate-runpath returns issues with installed binaries, so most likely "real" issues
2016-04-04 14:33:24	--	civodul` is now known as civodul
2016-04-04 14:43:10	rain1	yeah it is a real issue, cannot get the binaries towork at all
2016-04-04 14:43:15	rain1	I wish it would tell me more than: No such file or directory
2016-04-04 14:45:25	rain1	maybe I have to do this 'patch elf' httpsðŸ˜• /github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/compilers/mlton/default.nix#L79
2016-04-04 14:45:26	rain1	seems scary
2016-04-04 14:46:00	mark_weaver	rain1: let's try to avoid patch elf.  it basically only works on intel systems
2016-04-04 14:46:48	rain1	I might be out of luck on this one
2016-04-04 14:46:54	rain1	i just don't realy have an idea how to make it run
2016-04-04 14:47:18	mark_weaver	rain1: better to arrange to add "-Wl,-rpathðŸ˜• gnu/store/.../lib" to LDFLAGS, or something along those lines.
2016-04-04 14:47:35	rain1	i think that i can't do that because these binarie were already compiled without that
2016-04-04 14:47:56	rain1	maybe I could make my own binaries with that on a different OS (that already has this program)
2016-04-04 14:48:09	mark_weaver	ld-wrapper takes care of this automatically in most cases.  it would be interesting to know why that didn't work here, but manually adding those flags would be okay
2016-04-04 14:48:38	mark_weaver	rain1: to run binaries compiled elsewhere, you could set LD_LIBRARY_PATH before running the binary
2016-04-04 14:48:57	rain1	I had a go with LD_LIBRARY_PATH but no success
2016-04-04 14:49:10	rain1	this program dynamically links to libc libm and libgmp
2016-04-04 14:49:31	rain1	so I tried LD_LIBRARY_PATHðŸ˜• gnu/store/...-gmp-6.1.0ðŸ˜• gnu/store/...-glibc-2.22
2016-04-04 14:49:41	mark_weaver	you need to add /lib to those paths
2016-04-04 14:50:24	rain1	oh i did try that too

2016-04-04 15:02:29	bavier	rain1: is it not possible to bootstrap mlton without a prebuilt binary?
2016-04-04 15:02:47	rain1	i don't think so, it's written in mlton
2016-04-04 15:03:32	bavier	rain1: the Makefile seems to suggest that it will bootstrap itself without an existing binary
2016-04-04 15:03:50	rain1	well when I try to build it it complains about not being able to run mlton
2016-04-04 15:03:59	rain1	so I thought it needed one, maybe I'm wrong and its a different error

2016-04-04 16:48:56	kyamashita	Quick question: I've checked out the guix tree to define packages using git clone. How do I run guix lint on those packages that I've built (that aren't a part of the official tree)?
2016-04-04 16:51:54	lfam	kyamashita: You'll need to build (or at least ./configure) that tree to generate the file pre-inst-env'. Then, prefix your `guix` commands with ./pre-inst-env
2016-04-04 16:52:05	lfam	Sorry, I hit enter before I was done typing
2016-04-04 16:52:47	lfam	Prefix your invocations of `guix` to use the tree you've cloned rather than the one in ~/.config/guix/latest
2016-04-04 16:52:54	lfam	So, ./pre-inst-env guix lint foo
2016-04-04 16:53:13	kyamashita	Alright. Trying it now...
2016-04-04 16:53:38	lfam	Do you already have Guix or GuixSD installed?
2016-04-04 16:54:02	lfam	When configuring, you have to make sure to match the value of localstatedir to that of the pre-existing Guix installation
2016-04-04 16:54:12	lfam	Typically, it's like this: ./configure --localstatedir=/var
2016-04-04 16:54:37	kyamashita	I'm in GuixSD right now. And yes, I just saw that bit in the README.

2016-04-04 17:25:10	lfam	I never opened the LUKS partition while initializing the system. I wasn't sure if I should or not and I was curious about what would happen if I didn't
2016-04-04 17:25:20	rain1	I like a simple PS1: $ for user # for root
2016-04-04 17:25:54	kyamashita	I opened my LUKS partition and mounted it and my home directory still wasn't created.

2016-04-04 17:30:48	lfam	kyamashita: I had to remove the user from my configuration, reconfigure, then add the user back and reconfigure.
2016-04-04 17:31:03	lfam	Simply reconfiguring after deleting the user's home directory had no effect
2016-04-04 17:31:17	kyamashita	Interesting. What do you have in your home directory now?
2016-04-04 17:31:18	lfam	I recommend doing this if it's not too inconvenient
2016-04-04 17:31:50	lfam	Copied by hand, .bash_profile, .bashrc, .config/, .gdbinit, .guile-wm, .Xdefaults, .zlogin
2016-04-04 17:32:04	kyamashita	At this point it could be... I could backup everything first.
2016-04-04 17:32:09	lfam	Previously I had nothing
2016-04-04 17:32:45	lfam	I had forced the creation of .guix-profile by invoking the guix in /run/current-system/profile/bin but I could tell that things were still "off"
2016-04-04 17:33:07	lfam	All my environment variables were wrong
2016-04-04 17:33:11	kyamashita	Yeah, I don't have .gdbinit, .guile-wm, .Xdefaults, .zlogin
2016-04-04 17:33:13	lfam	Now everything "just works"
2016-04-04 17:33:20	kyamashita	I'll try it.
2016-04-04 17:33:37	lfam	I don't know *why* I have some of those files. This system doesn't have X, guile-wm, and I haven't used gdb
2016-04-04 17:33:45	lfam	The environment was the real problem
2016-04-04 17:34:16	lfam	And GuixSD sets package's search paths automatically, which is awesome. Having to export all the paths on a foreign distro is a PITA.
2016-04-04 17:34:25	lfam	I was worried that wasn't going to work
2016-04-04 17:35:03	kyamashita	Root gets the same base file layout in its directory as what you seem to have in your user directory now. I'll try copying over the files from root.
2016-04-04 17:36:23	lfam	I wonder how this issue could be avoided (besides initializing with the barest of bare-bones systems, and adding your user when reconfiguring).
2016-04-04 17:36:48	lfam	Actually, I think a bare-bones init is the way to go. Initialization is the most finicky part of GuixSD in my (limited) experience
2016-04-04 17:37:01	lfam	But users aren't going to follow that instruction
2016-04-04 17:37:34	lfam	And in the long run, GuixSD should be easy enough for anyone to get started with
2016-04-04 17:38:09	kyamashita	I agree. Is there a way to debug the initialization process during installation?
2016-04-04 17:38:20	lfam	What do you mean?
2016-04-04 17:39:10	kyamashita	Step through and see what's going on. I suppose that looking at the guix system init code would be a start.
2016-04-04 17:39:34	lfam	We've fielded similar questions about stepping through package building.
2016-04-04 17:39:57	lfam	I really have no idea how to achieve this, but right now your best bet is probably to invoke the relevant commands from a Guile REPL
2016-04-04 17:40:05	lfam	Which would require you to read the code and understand it
2016-04-04 17:41:09	kyamashita	Heh. I'm relatively new to both C and Guile.
2016-04-04 17:42:11	lfam	As I said, I have no idea how to do that ;) I'm pretty new to Scheme

2016-04-04 19:08:53	rain1	ah
2016-04-04 19:09:08	mark_weaver	and it also broke libextractor.  http://hydra.gnu.org:3000/build/1115271
2016-04-04 19:09:42	rain1	odd that blender broke
2016-04-04 19:10:19	mark_weaver	well, it uses ffmpeg, and apparently they made an API change that breaks a lot of things
2016-04-04 19:11:09	rain1	we have a problem with libextractor, it's already at the latest version
2016-04-04 19:11:56	rain1	for these two packages maybe it would be best to add back the old version of ffmpeg as a separate thing they can reference?
2016-04-04 19:11:58	mark_weaver	maybe there's a patch in their upstream repo
2016-04-04 19:12:03	rain1	or what do you think is the best solution
2016-04-04 19:12:06	rain1	ill check
2016-04-04 19:12:47	mark_weaver	ideally, we'd find patches to fix these things without adding back the old ffmpeg.  but if that fails, we could temporarily add the old ffmpeg.
2016-04-04 19:14:30	mark_weaver	my concern with adding the old ffmpeg is that ffmpeg has a large attack surface and is regularly exposed to potentially hostile data from the network.
2016-04-04 19:15:20	rain1	https://gnunet.org/bugs/view.php?id=4167 there's this for 2.9
2016-04-04 19:15:23	rain1	yes absolutely
2016-04-04 19:15:24	mark_weaver	and not all potentially-exploitable bugs are assigned CVEs
2016-04-04 19:15:41	rain1	I think ffmpeg was really due and upgrade
2016-04-04 19:15:51	rain1	i didn't know it would break things though
2016-04-04 19:16:17	mark_weaver	yeah, I wouldn't have known either.
2016-04-04 19:21:09	rain1	not sure where to get the information on which blender versions work with which ffmpeg versions
2016-04-04 19:21:18	rain1	people don't seem to want to list this sort of info anywhere
2016-04-04 19:21:45	rain1	I'll just try a version bump and see if it builds
2016-04-04 19:22:27	mark_weaver	rain1: okay.  while you do that, I'll test that patch you found for libextractor.
2016-04-04 19:22:36	mark_weaver	(which looks quite promising)
2016-04-04 19:28:43	mark_weaver	the patch helped, but was incomplete.  I should be able to finish it up

2016-04-05 00:04:07	ng0	ah okay. but the gnunet things are ready. the only thing lagging behind is me, as gnunet-svn depends on new description which depends on me contacting bug-womb with cg's approval
2016-04-05 00:04:15	ng0	which i have, so i need to contact bug-womb
2016-04-05 00:04:38	Jookia	Cool, but if you want people to be able to use your patches right away it'd be nice to be able to direct them to a script that will let them use them immediately. guix-now :P
2016-04-05 00:04:49	ng0	description update -> only patch which needs testing again is gnunet-svn without python.
2016-04-05 00:05:25	Jookia	I don't intend for it to fork but if it accumulates unmerged patches that refactor/change Guix enough it might end up that way

2016-04-05 00:06:37	Jookia	I might pull in your patches anyway since they're not in guix yet, unless someone merges them before I create whatever system I'm going to make
2016-04-05 00:07:30	ng0	please don't do it yet
2016-04-05 00:07:37	Jookia	Hmm?
2016-04-05 00:08:25	ng0	i have certain quality standards to my work (disregard what's in the gentoo repo currently though ;D), and the gnunet-svn patches are not done. what's done is gnurl.
2016-04-05 00:08:54	Jookia	Ah. But if they're usable, surely it'd be okay for them to be available for people to test/use without official merging?
2016-04-05 00:09:16	ng0	my name would still be on them.
2016-04-05 00:09:37	ng0	if it's indexed on the net, i'd like to only have complete patches out there.

2016-04-05 00:09:51	ng0	i know

2016-04-05 00:10:08	Jookia	I'll just put the first version that I did and gave to you up
2016-04-05 00:10:46	ng0	where as your repo would have to state it somewhere, then i would be okay with it. "currently being worked on, see link to threads"
2016-04-05 00:12:30	ng0	i just woke up, so i might take this in the confused way. but some link to the threads would be okay for me.

2016-04-05 01:58:21	iyzsong	yes, I think the gtk-update branch should be delete, and create a 'gnome-updates' branch.
2016-04-05 01:58:33	civodul	good, let's do that! :-)
2016-04-05 01:58:39	Jookia	Sounds good, though you'd still need the GTK+2 patch from the mailing list, which is identical in function but fixes GTK+2 too
2016-04-05 01:59:01	Jookia	There's also the need to patch some applications, mainly lxappearance and gnome-tweak-tool. I already have a patch for lxappearance but not the latter
2016-04-05 01:59:08	civodul	Jookia: is there a GTK+2 version of the theme patch coming from upstream?

2016-04-05 03:02:57	civodul	rekado_: but currently restart means "stop" followed by "start", which is also known as "reboot" in the case of PID 1 :-)
2016-04-05 03:08:21	efraim	how about launch a new shepard instance, move the children to the new instance, and do a rotate_root thingy to the new one?

2016-04-05 07:08:57	taylan	so that'd be gettext as an input
2016-04-05 07:10:13	taylan	never mind, apparently it has none
2016-04-05 07:10:43	taylan	rain1: oh and BTW, that's great! :)
2016-04-05 07:11:10	taylan	I love the idea of bridging the gap between devs and users

2016-04-05 07:15:13	htgoebel	HI, I'm new to guix and trying to find may way. I've set up guix onto a debian machine for testing.
2016-04-05 07:15:14	htgoebel	Now I want to use `guix enviroment -l ...` to setup an environment containing nginx and a small static website.
2016-04-05 07:15:14	htgoebel	Is there an example for this kind of stuff? (I did not find one)
2016-04-05 07:18:01	iyzsong	I don't see that, use 'guix environment --ad-hoc nginx' you only get nginx, and there need some step to run it manually..
2016-04-05 07:18:32	taylan	(off-topic: https://secure.avaaz.org/en/deartrump/ )
2016-04-05 07:23:21	htgoebel	iyzsong: This is just what I'm going to start with.
2016-04-05 07:23:36	htgoebel	And I want to have this reproducible in a .scm file
2016-04-05 07:23:44	htgoebel	like a operation-system definietion
2016-04-05 07:24:50	davexunit	htgoebel: doing what iyzsong suggests is good to start with
2016-04-05 07:25:16	davexunit	as an unprivileged user, you can then run nginx on a port numbered 1000 or greater and serve your static site
2016-04-05 07:26:49	htgoebel	davexunit: The aim is not to start nginx manually and passing it options. The aim is to fire up an environment (or whatever) and have an already configured nginx running in there.
2016-04-05 07:27:34	htgoebel	The next step then would be to have this nging talking to some fast-cgi server ...
2016-04-05 07:27:41	davexunit	htgoebel: that's not really going to work, sorry.
2016-04-05 07:27:50	htgoebel	... which is also started be this environment
2016-04-05 07:27:54	taylan	well, guix is just a package manager.  maybe guix + shepherd can do such a thing.
2016-04-05 07:28:28	iyzsong	yep, not now.  but I think that could be a container (launching the nginx shepherd service) and shared the working directory.
2016-04-05 07:28:40	davexunit	htgoebel: I mean you could something like: guix environment --ad-hoc nginx -- nginx -c some-config.conf
2016-04-05 07:28:50	htgoebel	iyzsong: MAybe something like that :-)
2016-04-05 07:29:26	rain1	thanks taylan :)
2016-04-05 07:29:35	davexunit	'guix environment' will run an arbitrary command for you.  in your case, you can use it to run whatever you need to set things up
2016-04-05 07:29:45	davexunit	I set up ruby on rails environments like this
2016-04-05 07:30:13	rain1	We reject your support for torture, your calls for murdering civilians, and your general encouragement of violence
2016-04-05 07:30:15	rain1	what is this
2016-04-05 07:30:16	htgoebel	davexunit: But guix already provides *a lot* of config managment options. Look at all this dovecot-stuff in sec. 7.2.7 of the manual.
2016-04-05 07:30:19	iyzsong	yes, 'guix environment' is designed just to give an environment, nothing more.
2016-04-05 07:30:44	htgoebel	Okay. I understood, `guix enviroment` is not what I want :-)
2016-04-05 07:31:06	taylan	rain1: an open letter to Donald Trump, a neo-fascist running for presidency in the US and gaining a lot of steam
2016-04-05 07:31:09	htgoebel	But what then?
2016-04-05 07:31:17	davexunit	htgoebel: 'guix system' handles full-system configuration
2016-04-05 07:31:47	rain1	obama is responsible for drone attacks
2016-04-05 07:32:18	davexunit	htgoebel: 'guix system container' will eventually be what you want, but it can't do networking at this time.
2016-04-05 07:32:23	taylan	we shouldn't go very off-topic in this channel I think :)
2016-04-05 07:32:52	davexunit	'guix system vm' might work, but I actually don't know if you can forward ports to it.
2016-04-05 07:33:27	efraim	mercurial updated, that takes care of the CVEs
2016-04-05 07:35:26	htgoebel	davexunit: I assume, I' defining a system like in sec. 7.2 of the manual, and just leave the disk-stuff (and such) away?!
2016-04-05 07:36:29	davexunit	htgoebel: yeah, mostly
2016-04-05 07:36:41	davexunit	I think you need to specify a bootloader field, but it isn't used

2016-04-05 07:42:57	davexunit	what's nice about guix is that you get to choose from many levels of isolation and pick the one that is most convenient for your needs.
2016-04-05 07:43:58	davexunit	'guix environment' provides simple environment variable based isolation and also a type of container, and 'guix system' can be used for making completely isolated systems in VMs or, eventually, in containers.

2016-04-05 07:46:11	davexunit	being able to compose environments like this is what makes it a total win over Docker and others.
2016-04-05 07:46:14	davexunit	see ya iyzsong
2016-04-05 07:46:52	davexunit	when 'guix deploy' has been written and our container implementation supports networking, we'll be able to do what docker-compose does.
2016-04-05 07:47:38	davexunit	oh, and the other big win is that you use the same software at all layers.  from the bare metal to the VM.

2016-04-05 10:01:04	ng0	more technical replies you might get from lynX and/or reading the wiki on it, it's just something which exists as a basic feature.
2016-04-05 10:03:01	davexunit	it just seems like brittle, inflexible software that thinks its more clever than it is.

2016-04-05 10:15:22	ng0	davexunit: psyced does not describe its own sourcecode. it only has programmable parts. the connected(?) editor is part of lpc. guix can not cope with this, but this is not a bug of lpc. anyway, talked this through and i know how it can be solved. resulting from this i wonder: is there no single chrooted software in guix? no chroot at all? did you just leave out this as a security decision? is there some paper
2016-04-05 10:15:25	ng0	or early videos/texts I can look into, because just trusting in the store seems not to be enough. i know guix departs from unix in some points, but why leave out chroot?

2016-04-05 10:32:35	rain1	just trying to build a package i made
2016-04-05 10:32:43	ng0	not really in the sense I would need it for. i assume guix environment assumes that all software is stateless?
2016-04-05 10:32:46	davexunit	you are making assertions about Guix that I don't think are true, but I don't understand psyced yet so I can't say for sure.
2016-04-05 10:33:15	davexunit	ng0: it's not 'guix environment', but that *everything* in the store *must* be immutable
2016-04-05 10:33:19	ng0	davexunit: i'm just starting to understand psyced more than I did before, so I can't really talk very much about it.
2016-04-05 10:34:04	ng0	it's a nice feature to have an immutable store, but some writeable location is sometimes needed for software which alters itself and has no static sourcecode.
2016-04-05 10:34:12	ng0	so currently i think:
2016-04-05 10:34:13	davexunit	computer systems have stateless components and stateful components.  the stateless stuff gets put in the store, and in the case of GuixSD, the stateful stuff lives in the service layer
2016-04-05 10:34:52	davexunit	I use gpg from guix, but when I run it it does stateful things to my home directory.
2016-04-05 10:35:01	davexunit	there's no conflict with this in guix.
2016-04-05 10:35:24	efraim	node bundles openssl?
2016-04-05 10:35:49	davexunit	efraim: yes, and other things.  it provides configure switches to force it to use shared libraries from the build environment though.
2016-04-05 10:36:02	efraim	noticed it while it was building
2016-04-05 10:36:07	ng0	guix package -i psyced -> postinstall hook activates a service which copies data outside into /opt/ or /var/ -> further hook runs the configuration of psyced, defining the data directory of psyced to be /opt/ or /var/ , where all symlinks it needs are in the structure they need to be.
2016-04-05 10:36:36	davexunit	ng0: we will not be implementing any sort of post-installation hooks
2016-04-05 10:36:56	ng0	i only described a one time service with it
2016-04-05 10:37:11	efraim	also, if you add sqlite to offlineimap and 'status_backed = sqlite' to .config/offlineimap/conf [Account] then syncing is faster
2016-04-05 10:37:22	davexunit	efraim: !
2016-04-05 10:37:28	davexunit	did not know about that!
2016-04-05 10:37:57	efraim	after taking forever to index my empty sync went down from 55 seconds to 37
2016-04-05 10:38:38	davexunit	efraim: do we need to sqlite as an input to the offlineimap package?
2016-04-05 10:38:45	efraim	yeah
2016-04-05 10:38:45	davexunit	if so, we should do that.
2016-04-05 10:38:53	davexunit	send patch? :)
2016-04-05 10:38:57	efraim	will do :)
2016-04-05 10:39:00	davexunit	efraim: thanks for the review by the way.
2016-04-05 10:39:11	ng0	should I start a conversation on the ML about it so that one of the developers of the protocol (and application) could join? I was not talking about any "hook", it was just a bad choice of words. I want the service which runs psyced to copy all datafiles into a writeable location, because else the software will not work.
2016-04-05 10:39:17	davexunit	I'll clean up the style nitpicks.  I'll see if anyone has any bigger problems with it.
2016-04-05 10:39:38	efraim	:)
2016-04-05 10:40:34	davexunit	ng0: I think that you should read up on how GuixSD services work and try writing a psyced service.
2016-04-05 10:42:00	ng0	i'm curently doing that.. I think from what I see it will require some more guile learning. I said I wanted to write a gnunet-service to work on and to extend later to some levels, but that's going to be less trouble (and higher priority) than psyced.
2016-04-05 10:45:15	efraim	bad news on the modular-qt front: the other downloads don't seem to ship with any way to build them, so it looks like we're stuck with monolithic

2016-04-05 13:46:49	rain1	<sugam> Hi all, i deleted an important tarball from my /gnu/store/ dir (3fx2sz92g8j6z152j3yjq203p87v7q7q-gcc-4.9.3.tar.xz) without successfully finishing compiling GCC 4.9.3, and now i cannot run guix build hello:
2016-04-05 13:47:01	rain1	<sugam> guix build: error: build failed: getting attributes of path `/gnu/store/3fx2sz92g8j6z152j3yjq203p87v7q7q-gcc-4.9.3.tar.xz': No such file or directory
2016-04-05 13:47:18	rain1	relaying a message for someone - if anyone knows what they should do i can tell them
2016-04-05 13:47:25	lfam	You really have to jump through some hoops to delete files in /gnu/store
2016-04-05 13:47:30	rain1	I suggested a guix system reconfigure but I don't know if its the best approach
2016-04-05 13:47:49	lfam	The whole system assumes that the store is immutable
2016-04-05 13:47:53	rain1	yeah..
2016-04-05 13:48:21	lfam	I would try to do `guix gc -d /gnu/store/3fx2sz92g8j6z152j3yjq203p87v7q7q-gcc-4.9.3.tar.xz` and then see what happens
2016-04-05 13:48:37	lfam	It would be easiest and sugam was in this channel
2016-04-05 13:48:42	lfam	"easiest if sugam"
2016-04-05 13:52:43	rain1	they said that freenode blocks tor
2016-04-05 13:52:50	rain1	so I asked if tehy'd like me to relay
2016-04-05 13:55:41	civodul	rain1: they could try "guix gc --verify"
2016-04-05 13:56:01	civodul	but removing/modifying files from the store voids one's warranty :-)
2016-04-05 13:56:05	rain1	<sugam> Oh that suggestion worked, thank you to lfam!
2016-04-05 13:56:18	rain1	sent thanks civodul too :)

2016-04-05 15:02:44	ng0	i like how atom and therefore apm builds with npm and the gentoo ebuild (not in portage) just lets it build like it would, without solving npm somehow, just letting npm be.
2016-04-05 15:03:06	ng0	or maybe it's doing something i don't see, but there's an endless list of "installing" scrolling by

2016-04-06 00:37:21	efraim	in this situation you mean that we provide the source and the binary
2016-04-06 00:38:44	efraim	if you have binary substitutes set up and you download the binary we should have the source. but if for some reason we don't have the source (ie low disk space) then it'll fall back to downloading from upstream
2016-04-06 00:39:12	jmarciano	I only mean that as such, distributing GPL2 packages is not in conformance. Other licenses I did not check
2016-04-06 00:39:21	efraim	if you don't have subsitutes set up then guix provides neither the source nor the binaries

2016-04-06 00:57:05	civodul	Guix & Nix are the only systems that really provide the Corresponding Source
2016-04-06 00:57:11	civodul	so i think we're rather safe here
2016-04-06 00:58:08	civodul	also, Guix distributes neither source nor binaries; instead it distributes executable recipes to fetch these
2016-04-06 00:59:15	jmarciano	I understand what you mean. But substitute is binary?
2016-04-06 00:59:47	civodul	not necessarily
2016-04-06 00:59:50	jmarciano	so, these substitutes do not conform to GPL2, because, there must be corresponding source to them.
2016-04-06 01:00:26	civodul	by definition, with Guix, if you can fetch the substitute (which has an unguessable URL), then you can also fetch the exact corresponding source
2016-04-06 01:00:35	civodul	and this is by construction
2016-04-06 01:01:15	jmarciano	I see, the definitions construct the sources, but those are not sources.
2016-04-06 01:02:05	jmarciano	with 3 years offer, GuixSD would need to provide for server storage to keep all the sources (not necessarily to offer them for download)

2016-04-06 01:11:26	jmarciano	GuixSD distribution was designed more for non copyleft licenses. But violates copyleft licenses.
2016-04-06 01:13:13	civodul	jmarciano: i respectfully think this is wrong
2016-04-06 01:13:29	civodul	you should carry strong accusations like this
2016-04-06 01:13:33	civodul	*shouldn't
2016-04-06 01:14:43	jmarciano	that you think it is wrong, I know. That is why I bring up important issue on GPL violation
2016-04-06 01:15:23	jmarciano	Specifically GPL 2, while GPL3 I did not fully review
2016-04-06 01:16:58	jmarciano	the problem would not be there, of course, if each user would build from sources. Then only binaries from GuixSD would need to be provided as sources depending of their licenses.
2016-04-06 01:17:12	df_	if whenever the binary substitute is available, the source is also, guixsd would appear to be covered by section 3a
2016-04-06 01:17:45	jmarciano	that was my first question, where is it? Maybe I don't understand it.

2016-04-06 01:19:33	df_	if I understand efraim correctly the substitutes server caches sources for the binaries it builds
2016-04-06 01:20:07	jmarciano	df_: do you know GPL2? Maybe you should first see it.
2016-04-06 01:20:21	df_	I have it open in front of me
2016-04-06 01:21:08	jmarciano	OK, so hydra and other servers distribute software, right?
2016-04-06 01:21:33	jmarciano	while GPL3 does allow to point to third party servers, GPL2 does not.
2016-04-06 01:21:36	df_	yes, both source and binaries
2016-04-06 01:24:15	civodul	again, Guix satisfies section 3a *by construction*
2016-04-06 01:24:19	df_	I just ran guix build --source hello and it downloaded the source from hydra
2016-04-06 01:26:22	jmarciano	yes, I see "by construction", I am sure that people can construct the source. Only that such construction is now allowed for certain license like GPL 2, it has to be accompanied with the complete corresponding source code"
2016-04-06 01:27:37	df_	ok I'm gonna try once more
2016-04-06 01:27:46	df_	there is a tarball on hydra containing the complete corresponding source
2016-04-06 01:28:27	jmarciano	for which package as example?
2016-04-06 01:28:49	df_	like I say, I tried hello, but I assume for any package that hydra builds
2016-04-06 01:28:56	jmarciano	hello is GPL3+
2016-04-06 01:29:15	df_	very well
2016-04-06 01:29:21	df_	I have just done exactly the same for linux-libre
2016-04-06 01:30:34	jmarciano	what is exactly cached and offered for download? The original source code?
2016-04-06 01:30:59	jmarciano	like the one with has in the package definition?
2016-04-06 01:31:02	jmarciano	Or the modified version?
2016-04-06 01:31:37	civodul	more generally, derivation outputs are cached
2016-04-06 01:31:55	civodul	see http://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/html_node/Derivations.html
2016-04-06 01:33:21	jmarciano	let me install one package, like aria2
2016-04-06 01:33:34	jmarciano	I have just got it downloaded from mirror.hydra.gnu.org
2016-04-06 01:33:54	jmarciano	where can I download the corresponding source code for aria2? This is very nice example.
2016-04-06 01:35:38	lfam	If you run the command `guix build -S aria2`, you will get the source code that was used to build the binary you just downloaded
2016-04-06 01:36:03	jmarciano	what do you mean "get"?
2016-04-06 01:36:09	lfam	It will be downloaded onto your computer
2016-04-06 01:36:24	jmarciano	let me do to understand
2016-04-06 01:37:17	-->	phant0mas (~quassel@pc130.nat2.teicrete.gr) has joined #guix
2016-04-06 01:38:45	jmarciano	I got aria2 package downloaded. It has the same hash like from the original location of the source code.
2016-04-06 01:38:58	jmarciano	so it is cached version of the original source code.
2016-04-06 01:39:34	jmarciano	if there are any patches to such packages (which I don't know, I was just reading definitions), those are modifications.
2016-04-06 01:39:48	jmarciano	and then the substitutes are distributed without corresponding source code.
2016-04-06 01:40:01	jmarciano	Which can be constructed, but is not in conformance with GPL2
2016-04-06 01:41:45	lfam	If there are patches, they will be applied to the source code that is downloaded.
2016-04-06 01:43:04	jmarciano	sure, but that is not in conformance to GPL 2
2016-04-06 01:43:33	jmarciano	if patches were applied to generate substitute, then the corresponding source code is not offered
2016-04-06 01:44:25	lfam	I don't know the terminology. My interpretation is that the patched code was used to build the binary, and thus corresponds to it.
2016-04-06 01:45:00	civodul	right, derivations are the corresonding source in the strictest sense of the word
2016-04-06 01:45:15	civodul	i realize we probably don't have good introductory material about this
2016-04-06 01:47:48	jmarciano	so, when patches are applied on hydra, there is source code containing such modifications, available to download?
2016-04-06 01:48:12	lfam	Yes, and it is used to build the binary substitute
2016-04-06 01:49:22	jmarciano	Let me see, where do patches come from? From source code? Or from where?
2016-04-06 01:50:01	jmarciano	btw. in case of aria2 package, not even the license is given, could not find it anywhere
2016-04-06 01:50:26	jmarciano	not in the substitute
2016-04-06 01:51:45	lfam	jmarciano: It's in aria2's man page
2016-04-06 01:54:34	jmarciano	well sure, but then you have to really understand section 1. as section 3. (substitute) ask for section 1 "conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program"
2016-04-06 01:55:52	jmarciano	in this example, I got substitute, but not the copy of the license. Reference in the man page is not a copy of the license.
2016-04-06 01:58:23	jmarciano	lfam: when patches modify the original source code, I get substitute, but where is then the corresponding source code to accompany the substitute in accordance with GPL 2? I hope you understand this and you will read GPL 2. Of course I do understand that I can "construct" - very nice, but it is not in conformance to license.
2016-04-06 01:59:07	lfam	I think you should send a message to the mailing list
2016-04-06 01:59:31	jmarciano	actually I hoped this was solved, I was rather questioning
2016-04-06 02:00:30	rekado	jmarciano: the patch sources are part of Guix.
2016-04-06 02:00:35	rekado	gnu/packages/patches
2016-04-06 02:00:43	jmarciano	aha thanks
2016-04-06 02:01:18	rekado	when you use "guix build -S" you get a tarball with the patches already applied
2016-04-06 02:02:19	jmarciano	I am not asking for myself. I know where can I get sources, or that I can construct them. That is however "description" how to ge corresponding source on his own computer. It is not "accompany with the corresponding source". So it violates GPL2
2016-04-06 02:02:47	civodul	jmarciano: no it doesn't
2016-04-06 02:03:22	jmarciano	I asked to give me example, so you can give me example, where is the source code for substitute which was patched?
2016-04-06 02:04:00	civodul	patches are just one aspect of what goes into the corresponding source
2016-04-06 02:04:17	civodul	Guix captures everything, including build scripts, dependencies, etc.
2016-04-06 02:04:21	jmarciano	sure, but give me one link, like example?
2016-04-06 02:04:39	civodul	there are 3000+ examples in the distro :-)
2016-04-06 02:05:22	jmarciano	do you avoid me?
2016-04-06 02:06:35	jmarciano	it should be simple to give the link to corresponding source, of the modified software (like patched one), under GPL2.
2016-04-06 02:07:23	civodul	as people already told you, "guix build --source foo" gives that
2016-04-06 02:07:43	jmarciano	that means I have to make it myself?
2016-04-06 02:07:43	civodul	"guix build -d foo" gives the super-complete corresponding source
2016-04-06 02:07:47	civodul	no
2016-04-06 02:07:51	jmarciano	aha
2016-04-06 02:08:54	jmarciano	is .drv downloaed from hydra?
2016-04-06 02:08:59	civodul	no
2016-04-06 02:09:50	jmarciano	so there is distribution of substitute without accompanying source code, which is against GPL 2. It should be solved.
2016-04-06 02:11:56	rekado	jmarciano: it seems we are miscommunicating.  What do you expect?  Why do you consider "guix build --source foo" to be a violation of the GPL 2?
2016-04-06 02:14:23	jmarciano	Section 2, (a), source code is not distributed under (a), (b) there is no written offer, (c) there is no offer.

2016-04-06 02:17:32	jmarciano	I just say, if there is derivation, which I understand as modified from original, or patched, such derivation shall accompany the object/binary or substitute.
2016-04-06 02:17:48	jmarciano	of course REGARDLESS if one uses GuixSD or guix package manager.
2016-04-06 02:18:52	civodul	we all agree on this
2016-04-06 02:19:06	civodul	i think Guix satisfies the requirement, more than any other distro in fact

2016-04-06 02:19:26	civodul	if you'd like to pursue this discussion, make sure to read more about derivations and substitutes
2016-04-06 02:19:43	civodul	for instance, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.4584v1 has an intro to derivations
2016-04-06 02:20:30	jmarciano	you gave me example of derivation. I did not check the example. I assumed it is true. So if derivation is modified, patched source code, or original source code, it shall accompany the binary.
2016-04-06 02:20:41	df_	ooh, I didn't know there was a paper
2016-04-06 02:21:00	civodul	and/or rephrase your answer to rekado
2016-04-06 02:21:27	civodul	because here it goes "why do you think it's violating GPL2? - because it's violating section 2"
2016-04-06 02:21:39	civodul	we're not making progress here :-)
2016-04-06 02:22:01	jmarciano	rekadod did not tell me, not to understand it

2016-04-06 03:23:23	rekado	the patches are referenced in other places.  That's why you get the error.
2016-04-06 03:23:27	jmarciano	did you understand why I removed patches?
2016-04-06 03:23:32	rekado	it doesn't matter
2016-04-06 03:23:44	rekado	I'm just telling you what the error means
2016-04-06 03:23:45	ng0	jmarciano: what exactly are you trying to understand
2016-04-06 03:23:50	jmarciano	OK, let us forget patches. Did you understand the test that I have done after that?
2016-04-06 03:23:55	jmarciano	ok thanks
2016-04-06 03:24:37	jmarciano	so that experiment with patch removal is not correct, but on the other hand, I could wget the package and compare to the one that I get with --source, so they are not the same -- source code is not accompanying the object code.
2016-04-06 03:24:50	jmarciano	Source code can be built, created, but that is not a distribution.

2016-04-06 03:52:22	rekado	rain1: union takes long when you have a lot of files in the profile.  I found that having libreoffice in the profile makes the union step unbearably slow (amplified by NFS)

2016-04-06 03:53:25	rekado	jmarciano: the two may differ when you are using a different version of Guix.  The hash depends on that.
2016-04-06 03:53:44	rekado	when you do "guix build -S" you get the URL of the cached sources.

2016-04-06 04:48:00	df_	out of interest, why are release tarballs preferred?  I'd have thought that using revision control would make it easier to get hold of the latest version to hack on

2016-04-06 05:32:30	ng0	suitsmeveryfine: are there versions other than 1.6.0 or why do you point to /tag/1.6.0/ ?
2016-04-06 05:33:42	ng0	i'll see what happens without 1.6
2016-04-06 05:35:17	suitsmeveryfine	ng0: yes, there are others but this is the lastest stable version.  I thought I should refer to this rather than just the current master.
2016-04-06 05:35:47	ng0	can you clone it again and tell me what the git log message is you see?
2016-04-06 05:36:04	ng0	date and time is enough

2016-04-06 06:31:30	davexunit	replacing the microcontroller with an AVR running free firmware that I'm writing.
2016-04-06 06:31:43	davexunit	mog: an atmega32u4 to be precise
2016-04-06 06:31:59	mog	yup i am familiar with the part
2016-04-06 06:32:04	davexunit	prototyping with an arduino leonardo, will use a different board for the real thing.
2016-04-06 06:32:15	mog	ya 32u4 is pretty big part for a controller
2016-04-06 06:32:24	mog	but always good to start big then go small
2016-04-06 06:32:30	davexunit	I'll keep the 32u4 for the real thing
2016-04-06 06:32:40	davexunit	because it has built-in usb chip
2016-04-06 06:33:01	mog	ya but i mean an 8u4 would probably work as well
2016-04-06 06:33:52	davexunit	mog: sure, but it would be a matter of finding something like this for it https://www.adafruit.com/products/296
2016-04-06 06:34:05	davexunit	unless the 8u4 isn't a surface mount chip
2016-04-06 06:34:06	davexunit	then maybe
2016-04-06 06:34:15	davexunit	but being able to flash via USB is very valuable to me
2016-04-06 06:34:17	mog	ahh id figure you were making a whole board
2016-04-06 06:34:27	mog	i agree usb is where its at

2016-04-06 07:42:20	civodul	the error i have is that it fails while building GCC, exiting with code 1, but not printing any error message
2016-04-06 07:42:45	davexunit	the binutils folks should use guix to integration test new releases!

2016-04-06 07:43:42	rain1	what is the problem with binutils?
2016-04-06 07:44:11	rain1	upgrade breaking things is a tough problem
2016-04-06 07:52:09	rain1	I could not resolve the problem with upgrading python
2016-04-06 07:52:15	rain1	I think it has to wait for python developers to fix the code

2016-04-06 08:01:07	Jookia	hmm, sdl-union's sdl-config doesn't really help
2016-04-06 08:01:26	Jookia	davexunit: is it meant to make sdl-config output a different include path?
2016-04-06 08:02:42	davexunit	Jookia: yeah, well, it makes it so that all of the header files are in a single directory together
2016-04-06 08:02:48	davexunit	rather than spread out amongst many store items
2016-04-06 08:02:57	davexunit	and that satisfies things that build with sdl
2016-04-06 08:03:12	Jookia	ah, well chocolate-doom uses sdl-config to find sdl and assumes sdl-mixer is in that location
2016-04-06 08:03:20	Jookia	so ill have to patch chocolate-doom
2016-04-06 08:03:42	davexunit	Jookia: I don't follow.  sdl-union makes that so.
2016-04-06 08:03:48	davexunit	it includes sdl-mixer in the union
2016-04-06 08:04:02	Jookia	sdl-config --cflags points to just sdl's include dir
2016-04-06 08:04:06	Jookia	not the union's include dir
2016-04-06 08:04:32	quiliro	the other times i tried to install guixsd with "guix system init /mnt/etc/desktop.scm /mnt" but it didn't work...i did not have time to stay where there is internet so i didn't even copy the error even to
2016-04-06 08:04:55	quiliro	and i thought the download would be recorded to the disk
2016-04-06 08:05:12	quiliro	is there a way i can make an offline installation?
2016-04-06 08:05:48	davexunit	Jookia: are you including other sdl packages as inputs or just the union?
2016-04-06 08:06:00	Jookia	just the union
2016-04-06 08:06:05	davexunit	maybe this is a case that the union doesn't work for, but it's solved every other sdl problem so I'm skeptical
2016-04-06 08:06:16	Jookia	let me paste the output
2016-04-06 08:06:43	davexunit	I can't really help you dig too deep right now (working on bugs at work)
2016-04-06 08:07:05	davexunit	but if it's not working, just try patching it as you were going to do
2016-04-06 08:07:14	davexunit	I'm out of ideas :)
2016-04-06 08:07:31	Jookia	heh, alright :)
2016-04-06 08:07:34	Jookia	thanks for your help
2016-04-06 08:08:16	davexunit	maybe we can find something to change about sdl-union
2016-04-06 08:13:20	Jookia	davexunit: Looks like sdl-config is a shell script with a variable I can substitute. Shall do

2016-04-06 08:16:14	rekado	is it part of the output when running "guix system reconfigure" or "guix system init"?
2016-04-06 08:16:24	davexunit	phant0mas: is there some build logs that would be useful to them that we could send?

2016-04-06 08:26:57	anthk_	an easy introduction to guile/scheme, not being SICP nor GNU info docs?
2016-04-06 08:28:47	df_	http://ds26gte.github.io/tyscheme/ maybe?
2016-04-06 08:29:55	df_	the guile manual is very good imo though
2016-04-06 08:35:14	rekado	anthk_: the Guile manual is actually really nice.
2016-04-06 08:35:20	rekado	the beginning at least.
2016-04-06 08:35:42	rekado	but since you wrote "nor GNU info docs"...
2016-04-06 08:35:55	rekado	maybe the little schemer, but that's pretty basic and somewhat repetitive.
2016-04-06 08:36:13	ijp	also not free as in cool free ringtones
2016-04-06 08:36:14	rekado	I know it get's more interesting, but I find it a bit frustrating.
2016-04-06 08:37:30	davexunit	rekado: it's definitely not written for more experienced programmers
2016-04-06 08:37:37	davexunit	the later chapters are very interesting
2016-04-06 08:38:06	davexunit	maybe The Seasoned Schemer would be more up your alley
2016-04-06 08:38:14	ijp	maybe we are getting to the stage where there needs to be a "basic guile for guix" tutorial
2016-04-06 08:38:56	ng0	somebody would have to write that though..
2016-04-06 08:39:25	davexunit	yeah I think that tutorial would be very nice
2016-04-06 08:39:29	ijp	I wonder what the "peak experience" for writing tutorials is?
2016-04-06 08:39:36	ng0	now we only have asorted info all over the internet about guix
2016-04-06 08:39:37	davexunit	yeah
2016-04-06 08:40:34	ng0	definitive a chapter for advanced knowledge/time: write good system services.
2016-04-06 08:40:40	rain1	all over the internet? we could collect it all into one location
2016-04-06 08:43:10	ng0	i try to revise come next december and see what I learned and where I made notes, where beginners problems are, but that would be from the perspective of someone not completely new to the syntax and definitely not new to packaging in general. a beginners guide in our sense would have to pick up people whee they are, giving also the option to pick them up at 0
2016-04-06 08:43:23	df_	I have found it quite hard to grok various guixy concepts, but not particularly to do with guile/scheme
2016-04-06 08:44:31	rain1	it's good if everyone takes notes on what they learn and merge it into a document
2016-04-06 08:47:44	df_	sounds like a job for a wiki
2016-04-06 08:48:31	davexunit	a wiki could be used as a place to draft something, but all official documentation belongs in the manual
2016-04-06 08:49:35	rain1	df_, yeah i put up a wiki for this
2016-04-06 08:49:45	davexunit	I recommend just using the libreplanet.org wiki
2016-04-06 08:49:51	davexunit	we already have a guix group thing on it
2016-04-06 08:50:38	Jookia	I have forgotten the command to patch shebangs from a terminal
2016-04-06 08:50:43	Jookia	s/command/guile expression
2016-04-06 08:51:29	Jookia	guile -e '(@@ (guix build gnu-build-system) patch-source-shebangs) #:source ".")' seems to kinda work
2016-04-06 08:52:55	Jookia	s/-e/-c/ fixes it
2016-04-06 08:56:44	rekado	davexunit: yeah, the other Schemer books are on my list; wanted to go through them once I'm done with SICP, but first I'll have to finish a couple of bioinfo books.
2016-04-06 08:56:50	rekado	I really should stop working.
2016-04-06 08:57:24	ijp	SICP is nice, but for people who want to just learn scheme, it's really inefficient
2016-04-06 08:58:03	davexunit	yeah
2016-04-06 09:02:04	Jookia	i have sdl-union fixed and now i have chocolate doom running in guix!
2016-04-06 09:02:29	rain1	great :D
2016-04-06 09:03:22	davexunit	Jookia: yay!
2016-04-06 09:03:25	rekado	the stuff on syntax in "the land of lisp" (I think) was not so bad.  But I didn't enjoy the book that much.  Too much imperative programming, too much Common Lisp.
2016-04-06 09:04:10	davexunit	common lisp has land of lisp
2016-04-06 09:04:14	davexunit	racket has realm of racket
2016-04-06 09:04:18	davexunit	now I want galaxy of guile
2016-04-06 09:04:40	davexunit	I flipped through realm of racket in a bookstore recently, it was pretty neat looking.
2016-04-06 09:04:51	davexunit	also has a focus on games
2016-04-06 09:04:51	rekado	I only have the epub.
2016-04-06 09:05:09	davexunit	I don't know if anything can beat "Grand Theft Wumpus" in Land of Lisp, though
2016-04-06 09:05:11	rekado	maybe I'm just boring, but I didn't really like that.
2016-04-06 09:05:38	davexunit	prognosis: boring
2016-04-06 09:06:06	davexunit	yeah, I guess it isn't for everyone
2016-04-06 09:06:53	Jookia	one advantage with guix is that we could package old versions of WADs and use 'guix environment freedom@0.9' then run your favourite doom client with an old wad
2016-04-06 09:06:59	Jookia	since DOOMWADPATH can be set up
2016-04-06 09:07:09	rekado	confirmed boring.
2016-04-06 09:07:21	rain1	Jookia, that would be so cool!
2016-04-06 09:07:54	rekado	I find games rather atypical.
2016-04-06 09:08:12	Jookia	'guix environment --ad-hoc odamex freedom@0.10 freedom@0.9' would allow for playing older versions online however there's the caveat that you can't really select which version with any of the GUIs i've tried
2016-04-06 09:08:23	rekado	unless we used a functional reactive programming framework.
2016-04-06 09:08:26	rekado	oh, wait.  That's even more atypical.
2016-04-06 09:08:28	Jookia	so in that case it'd default to 0.10 unless you joined at online game
2016-04-06 09:08:33	davexunit	games are good when you want to dive into asynchronous programming problems
2016-04-06 09:08:59	davexunit	I liked the variety of problem spaces explored in SICP
2016-04-06 09:11:50	df_	some of them annoy me, I didn't really want to have to remember calculus
2016-04-06 09:12:36	davexunit	right, it has a lot of calculus stuff.  an introductory book not made for MIT students would have less or none of that ;)
2016-04-06 09:14:08	rekado	so, who wants to co-author Galaxy of Guile?
2016-04-06 09:14:14	davexunit	;)
2016-04-06 09:14:32	df_	that said, getting a working symbolic maths manipulation system (albeit a rudimentary one) working was quite a buzz in the end
2016-04-06 09:14:33	anthk_	calculus is useful for sly
2016-04-06 09:14:34	davexunit	I seriously think that such a book would be wonderful
2016-04-06 09:14:54	rekado	I don't think one needs to touch calculus in a programming book.
2016-04-06 09:15:01	davexunit	df_: Sussman is coming out with a new book about the subject
2016-04-06 09:15:11	df_	it was just an example problem space, I think
2016-04-06 09:15:23	anthk_	rekado maybe the big O notation
2016-04-06 09:15:28	rekado	for FRP it's enough to make the mental shift from discrete values to continuous values or "signals".
2016-04-06 09:15:46	anthk_	damn fourier
2016-04-06 09:15:50	rekado	anthk_: I'd also drop that and focus on "the shape" of a process as in SICP.
2016-04-06 09:16:07	davexunit	rekado: yeah for FRP you really need to just understand a DAG
2016-04-06 09:16:48	ijp	rekado: it's not even really necessary for a CS degree, although it can occasionally be useful
2016-04-06 09:16:50	df_	I also think SICP does some things deliberately 'wrong', in order to make a point
2016-04-06 09:17:14	ijp	except for streams, there was no point in doing that one wrong
2016-04-06 09:17:18	df_	like the non-deterministic evaluator teaches you about continuations but I don't think it's anything like how I'd approach such a problem in real life
2016-04-06 09:17:26	davexunit	ijp: oopsies!
2016-04-06 09:21:59	anthk_	SICP's curve is like... first code with pen and paper, and then pass it to Geiser

2016-04-06 10:06:36	ng0	http://www.kreativekorp.com/software/fonts/index.shtml
2016-04-06 10:07:32	jmd	That license is not free.
2016-04-06 10:08:21	ng0	is it close enough to free font licenses that I could contact them and ask them to relicense?
2016-04-06 10:09:04	bavier	ng0: you can always ask for a relicense, whether or not the current is close
2016-04-06 10:09:10	ng0	true
2016-04-06 10:09:30	ng0	but I assume they are more welcome towards something which is only slightly different
2016-04-06 10:10:24	anthk_	Jookia,  gloome should be free now
2016-04-06 10:10:46	Jookia	i've heard about gloome
2016-04-06 10:10:53	Jookia	not sure if it's worth packaging?
2016-04-06 10:11:34	ng0	have you forgotten about the unwritten goal, gnu/worlddomination?
2016-04-06 10:11:42	bavier	ng0: items 1 and 2 seem to be the issues in that license
2016-04-06 10:11:53	jmd	bavier: Item 5 too.
2016-04-06 10:12:06	ng0	also 4
2016-04-06 10:12:13	davexunit	Jookia: if you want to use it, and it's free, then it's worth packaging :)
2016-04-06 10:12:18	bavier	jmd: right
2016-04-06 10:12:23	jmd	ng0: No.  4 is ok.
2016-04-06 10:12:34	jmd	The GPL has a similar clause.
2016-04-06 10:12:43	Jookia	davexunit: I shall package all I can then ;)
2016-04-06 10:12:47	davexunit	I've been a little concerned lately about people on the gnu-linux-libre list trying to make judgements about what's "worth" packaging.
2016-04-06 10:13:14	davexunit	if it's free, and someone wants to do the work to package, then why try to stop them by saying it's not "worth it"?
2016-04-06 10:13:18	civodul	indeed
2016-04-06 10:13:28	Jookia	This is true
2016-04-06 10:13:39	Jookia	Right now I'm messing with Timidity
2016-04-06 10:13:55	jmd	Right.  What is not worth it for one person, may well be for another.
2016-04-06 10:13:55	bavier	I've felt the same way
2016-04-06 10:14:16	davexunit	the word "useless" has been used.
2016-04-06 10:14:45	ng0	and even if you will stop it, somebody will do it. like some people might not see why some nonfree software is not available, they will package it and it will be available to people outside of the master
2016-04-06 10:14:59	Jookia	I didn't mean to stir up trouble with that statement- from what I understand in the Doom engines there's only a few 'big' ones that have distinguishing features
2016-04-06 10:15:03	bavier	concern over efficient use of volunteer efforts, which can be self-defeating
2016-04-06 10:15:05	efraim	the only real argument I could see against inclusion would be against spending compile time on hydra
2016-04-06 10:15:20	davexunit	Jookia: you're not stirring up trouble, but you triggered a feeling I've had the past few days.
2016-04-06 10:15:33	davexunit	which is unrelated to your particular doom packaging stuff. :)
2016-04-06 10:15:55	Jookia	This is over the MAME stuff?
2016-04-06 10:16:01	davexunit	it's in that thread, yeah.
2016-04-06 10:16:20	efraim	pygame has been kicking my butt the past few days
2016-04-06 10:16:23	ng0	is it worth following? I stopped after 10 messages
2016-04-06 10:16:27	davexunit	I just don't think it's good for us to say that a free program is or is not useful.
2016-04-06 10:16:31	davexunit	ng0: no.
2016-04-06 10:16:52	davexunit	the matter is resolved once josh gay from the fsf chimes in.
2016-04-06 10:17:07	ng0	ok
2016-04-06 10:17:28	Jookia	It's definitely not worth saying that something's useful or not, though I think there needs to be explicit packaging criteria, even if it's just 'if it's of use to someone, it can be added and might be removed if not maintained'
2016-04-06 10:17:29	civodul	yes, jgay's analysis was very thoughtful and valuable
2016-04-06 10:17:41	efraim	bambam https://github.com/porridge/bambam is actually one of my blockers for switching to guixsd
2016-04-06 10:17:45	ng0	useful in one persons dictionary might not be useful in another persons.
2016-04-06 10:17:58	efraim	the other is gcompris
2016-04-06 10:18:08	rain1	for some reason nobody replied to me on gnu-linux-libre
2016-04-06 10:18:12	rain1	I wonder why?
2016-04-06 10:18:13	davexunit	Jookia: the criteria is basically: 1) is it free? 2) does it build?
2016-04-06 10:18:21	davexunit	if yes to both, we're good.
2016-04-06 10:18:33	ng0	if only 1, fix 2
2016-04-06 10:18:33	Jookia	I'm going to package everything that interests me then :P
2016-04-06 10:18:49	bavier	efraim: I started on gcompris a while ago; I'm not sure how far I got.
2016-04-06 10:19:05	rain1	davexunit, I felt the same way, it's a bit sad that people are not appreciating what the MAME developers have done more
2016-04-06 10:19:08	davexunit	I can see us removing things that have been broken for a long time with no one stepping up to fix them.
2016-04-06 10:19:09	efraim	i started too, I have incomplete patches for gcompris and gcompris-qt
2016-04-06 10:19:33	civodul	davexunit: free + the other criteria of the FSDG, such as not recommending non-free software
2016-04-06 10:19:40	davexunit	civodul: right
2016-04-06 10:19:47	davexunit	trying to keep it brief ;)
2016-04-06 10:19:50	civodul	right :-)
2016-04-06 10:20:05	davexunit	on a formal list, I'd add notes about bundling and stuff
2016-04-06 10:20:30	Jookia	That reminds me: Is mentioning nonfree software a problem? Not sure if it's worth patching all the doom ports to not refer to Doom95 or DOS
2016-04-06 10:20:36	bavier	efraim: gamine is fun, looks similar to bambam
2016-04-06 10:21:36	efraim	i'll look at it, but my 15 monther loves smashing the keyboard
2016-04-06 10:23:41	ng0	wild. sometimes guix or coreboot or whatever assumes that I switched to a tv and the screen goes black for a second
2016-04-06 10:23:52	ng0	s/coreboot//
2016-04-06 10:26:06	efraim	i got abiword up to 3.0.1 but I had to disable tests due to issues with accessing the screen from the build environment
2016-04-06 10:27:38	jmd	efraim: What do you mean "accessing the screen" ?
2016-04-06 10:28:01	efraim	Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_settings_get_for_screen: assertion 'GDK_IS_SCREEN (screen)' failed
2016-04-06 10:28:21	jmd	Oh you mean it needs an X server

2016-04-06 10:44:48	davexunit	but a build phase procedure must return #t if it was successful
2016-04-06 10:45:13	davexunit	efraim: I don't understand

2016-04-06 10:46:42	efraim	sounds good
2016-04-06 10:46:46	davexunit	it turns out that returning an unspecified value is not considered false, so this is a style guideline more than a strict necessity.

I was pointing out to GPL violations such as "GPL license missing" in the object package. That is very valid argument. People like me are people who know what GPL means for future.
2016-04-06 11:01:13	ng0	i only said "like jm" because i did not want your attention through highlighting your name
2016-04-06 11:01:34	jmarciano	I am fine, I hope you are fine too, if you speak on public channel you get public attention.
2016-04-06 11:03:00	Jookia	GPL violations arent always bad
2016-04-06 11:03:36	jmarciano	I am somebody who likes 4 freedoms, that is all. I value the principles of copyleft. Actually, I got it in a dream yesterday, woke up, checked it, could not find it, so I wish first to be wrong. I don't like this kind of teaching.
2016-04-06 11:03:48	lfam	jmarciano: This was very rude and I would also call it inaccurate: "it seems it was by design forgotten to comply to the GPL 2 license."
2016-04-06 11:04:17	Jookia	it's very hard to comply with the GPL so violations are often unintentional
2016-04-06 11:04:32	lfam	Of the packaging systems I have used, Guix (and Nix) are the best at providing the corresponding source of a given binary.
2016-04-06 11:04:57	jmarciano	I have done my  first distribution back in 2003. I have provided to other people full source code. It was not so hard. 3 diskettes and few diskettes of source code.
2016-04-06 11:05:13	lfam	I think you should not start by accusing people of intentional wrongdoing
2016-04-06 11:05:22	jmarciano	There must be function that injects the corresponding license into the object package.
2016-04-06 11:05:26	 *	rain1 reminder about DOS attacks

2016-04-06 11:06:06	jmarciano	How do I know who intended what, I don't know where are people located and I don't care.
2016-04-06 11:06:07	lfam	In the part I quoted above, the meaning is equivalent in English
2016-04-06 11:06:21	Jookia	you should care
2016-04-06 11:06:26	jmarciano	rain1: you can stop with childish behavior.
2016-04-06 11:06:40	jmarciano	No I don't care where somebody is located.
2016-04-06 11:07:08	Jookia	you should care about their intentions
2016-04-06 11:07:09	lfam	I do think we should resolve this issue, whether it is a miscommunication or a real problem.
2016-04-06 11:07:16	jmarciano	it should be easy for certain licenses that have to be distributed with binary object code, to provide a function that injects the appropriate license or copies it into the binary package (substitute)
2016-04-06 11:07:16	Jookia	not sure how thats related to their location

2016-04-06 11:08:32	jmarciano	absolutely no personal attacks from my side. I am sorry if anyone thinks that. I see that as advanced distribution and I value people who makes it.
2016-04-06 11:08:39	rain1	"All complaints will be reviewed and investigated"
2016-04-06 11:08:46	rain1	i am making a complaint
2016-04-06 11:09:08	davexunit	I really don't even know what we are talking about
2016-04-06 11:09:09	lfam	I think that there is a language barrier. I wish we could communicate in our native languages (mine is English).
2016-04-06 11:09:11	jmarciano	rain1: if you make a complaint, you stop referring please to me as DOS. I am not a child, I am adult.
2016-04-06 11:09:31	Jookia	DOS = child? O.o
2016-04-06 11:09:34	jmarciano	just come back to subject, like "how to handle inclusion of licenses"
2016-04-06 11:09:40	davexunit	but let's all be civil here.
2016-04-06 11:09:51	Jookia	davexunit is right
2016-04-06 11:09:58	davexunit	I also suspect there to be a language barrier here
2016-04-06 11:10:00	Jookia	what licenses aren't being included?
2016-04-06 11:10:06	davexunit	so let's try to be patient
2016-04-06 11:10:06	jmarciano	give me assignment like something to do, that is on my level and I will do.
2016-04-06 11:10:23	davexunit	is there a package in guix that has problematic licensing?
2016-04-06 11:10:43	jmarciano	davexunit: please first tell me, do you know the GPL2?
2016-04-06 11:11:18	lfam	This is really making this channel useless. Over and over the same discussion with no communication or resolution
2016-04-06 11:11:19	davexunit	jmarciano: I'm no expert, but sure.
2016-04-06 11:11:33	lfam	It's worse than /usr/bin/env
2016-04-06 11:11:34	jmarciano	You can open it, and look section 3.
2016-04-06 11:11:47	jmarciano	I understand that some people cannot confront it.
2016-04-06 11:12:05	davexunit	jmarciano: are you trying to say that Guix is somehow violating the GPL?
2016-04-06 11:12:10	jmarciano	yes.
2016-04-06 11:12:25	jmarciano	and in general, not just like package, but multiple packages.
2016-04-06 11:12:42	davexunit	hold on a minute, let's go slowly here.
2016-04-06 11:12:53	jmarciano	GuixSD uses hydra and other mirrors for distribution of object or executable packages.
2016-04-06 11:12:54	davexunit	the GPL does *not* apply to the source code of the things we package.
2016-04-06 11:12:58	rain1	yeah davexunit please move this to PM
2016-04-06 11:13:08	rain1	this is denial of service on the IRC channel
2016-04-06 11:13:13	Jookia	i'm kinda interested in this discussion

2016-04-06 11:13:47	davexunit	rain1: I'm sorry, what complaint?
2016-04-06 11:13:57	davexunit	I'm lost in all of this.  I feel like I'm missing a lot of context.
2016-04-06 11:13:59	jmarciano	So under the section 1. "and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program"
2016-04-06 11:14:04	davexunit	who is this complaint directed at?
2016-04-06 11:14:19	rain1	mark_weaver, around?
2016-04-06 11:14:22	jmarciano	at those who make binary packages of Guix that are distributed from Hydra and other mirrors (official)
2016-04-06 11:14:37	davexunit	jmarciano: the complete and corresponding source code for guix is provided in our git repository and release tarballs.
2016-04-06 11:14:37	jmarciano	so the object or executable package when distributed must include the license of the GPL

2016-04-06 11:16:25	Jookia	rain1: basically, Doom music
2016-04-06 11:16:29	jmarciano	davexunit: yes
2016-04-06 11:16:29	rain1	ohh
2016-04-06 11:16:35	rain1	im interested in that
2016-04-06 11:17:15	jmarciano	davexunit: one cannot compare himself to those who don't value free software, like Debian group of people.
2016-04-06 11:17:28	Jookia	rain1: There's to MIDI systems, timidity and fluidsynth- i have them kind of running but they both require messing about with global state
2016-04-06 11:17:33	Jookia	two* sorry, my w key is going
2016-04-06 11:17:36	davexunit	Debian very much values free software.

2016-04-06 11:17:47	rain1	I used timidity++ in guix
2016-04-06 11:17:54	jmarciano	yes, but in their terminology.
2016-04-06 11:18:00	Jookia	rain1: Oh, how'd you configure it?
2016-04-06 11:18:10	rain1	I mean as a standalone program, not related to doom
2016-04-06 11:18:16	Jookia	ah
2016-04-06 11:18:23	davexunit	jmarciano: you may have a point that there is something to fix here, I can't say for sure, but I am feeling a good deal of hostility from you about this and that I do not appreciate.
2016-04-06 11:18:25	rain1	do you have a package for this? I could look at it
2016-04-06 11:18:35	jmarciano	davexunit: you get a wrong feeling.
2016-04-06 11:18:39	Jookia	rain1: i don't yet, i haven't package anything aside from manually building
2016-04-06 11:18:46	rain1	oh alright!
2016-04-06 11:18:56	davexunit	jmarciano: perhaps it's a language thing, but I'm not the only one that feels that this is a hostile situation.
2016-04-06 11:19:10	jmarciano	that kind of explanation does not help with putting licenses in object packages.
2016-04-06 11:19:15	ng0	jmarciano: you could have first tried to resolve the problem in length here other than trying for some moments and than go to a mailinglist not connected to guix
2016-04-06 11:19:30	ng0	if it's a problem, we can fix it
2016-04-06 11:19:35	Jookia	Complying with the GPL is very difficult in some cases
2016-04-06 11:19:41	Jookia	Video games for one
2016-04-06 11:19:56	Jookia	Going down the track for literal GPL complying can be a difficult thing
2016-04-06 11:20:04	jmarciano	ng0: thanks, that is how you would do, I do like I think it is more right. As it discusses free software distributions (including GuixSD)
2016-04-06 11:20:08	davexunit	jmarciano: I don't understand why you posted to the gnu-linux-libre mailing list first instead of filing a bug with us.
2016-04-06 11:20:33	jmarciano	to complay with GPL 2, to copy License into the binary distribution is easy matter. But sorry I cannot do that, I don't know how yes.
2016-04-06 11:20:35	jmarciano	yet
2016-04-06 11:21:15	jmarciano	as there is by my understanding discussion of free software distributions
2016-04-06 11:21:37	jmarciano	and it is matter of design, not only a bug in single package, so far I am yet to find a package where there is a license inside
2016-04-06 11:21:44	-->	heisenbug (~heisenbug@197.237.241.43) has joined #guix
2016-04-06 11:21:52	Jookia	some more open questions: does video game art require license information to be placed on the images/models? how do we go about giving source code to serverside addons in a way that complies with the GPL?
2016-04-06 11:22:17	davexunit	jmarciano: can you please file a bug report that there *may* be a problem here, so we can keep track of it and look into it?  this might be a matter than ludovic will sort out with the help of other GNU people.
2016-04-06 11:22:27	Jookia	can free javascript comply with the letter of the law of the GPL? :P
2016-04-06 11:22:48	jmarciano	he knows about it, no need to be bureaucrat on my side
2016-04-06 11:22:51	ng0	jmarciano: do I understand you right that you think every software which passes the way from external build farm to system running guix should include a physical copy of the licenses in the file or attached rather than having the collected licenses linked?
2016-04-06 11:23:15	jmarciano	ng0: I am not sure to understand that.
2016-04-06 11:23:16	davexunit	jmarciano: there, right there, do you see why people get a negative impression?
2016-04-06 11:23:33	Jookia	actually on topic: should patched software link to the guix source code as corresponding source?
2016-04-06 11:23:37	davexunit	you will write an essay to gnu-linux-libre, but you won't put a bug in our bug tracker.
2016-04-06 11:23:55	<--	rain1 (~rain1@unaffiliated/rain1) has left #guix ("Leaving")
2016-04-06 11:23:58	jmarciano	ng0: if there is package on a server (substitute), and if licenses requires that license is distributed with object or executable code, and if license is not there, question is why and how it has to be remedied.
2016-04-06 11:24:03	davexunit	we're a distribution commited to the GNU FSDG, please assume good faith.
2016-04-06 11:24:20	jmarciano	davexunit: sure, if I don't assume, I would not be talking here at all.
2016-04-06 11:24:35	davexunit	even if we know about an issue, we need a way to manage issues, and that's what the bug tracker is for.
2016-04-06 11:24:57	jmarciano	it is not a "bug"
2016-04-06 11:24:59	davexunit	that makes sure that it's not forgotten about, and that the problem and resolution are documented and archive for future reference
2016-04-06 11:25:03	jmarciano	it is GPL violation
2016-04-06 11:25:11	ng0	jmarciano: everything which is not intended as is, is a bug
2016-04-06 11:25:16	jmarciano	you can copy it back to bugs, if you wish
2016-04-06 11:25:23	jmd	jmarciano: Then report it to the copyright holder.
2016-04-06 11:25:35	jmarciano	jmd: that is absolutely not my intention.
2016-04-06 11:25:37	davexunit	I'd like to stop this conversation here.
2016-04-06 11:25:42	Jookia	^
2016-04-06 11:25:53	davexunit	discussing it further will be unproductive.
2016-04-06 11:25:55	jmarciano	well I will stop here too, no problem.
2016-04-06 11:26:22	davexunit	jmarciano: please give us some time to look into what you've reported and see what we need to do to resolve it, if anything.
2016-04-06 11:27:02	jmarciano	sure, I know, I would not even answer here if I was not called "people like jm" or "Denial of Service Attack"
2016-04-06 11:27:56	ng0	and your level of language and behavior wasn't nice either. as I told you in the direct message you did sent, I had no intentions to "call names"
2016-04-06 11:28:02	jmarciano	people can also propose to me: we are here to comply to the GPL inclusion of license, the fee would be that much, is there a donation available, and I will think about it.
2016-04-06 11:28:24	Jookia	let's talk about MIDI instead
2016-04-06 11:28:29	ng0	I won't apologize because I don't appreciate how you get to solving problems. that's just me personally.
2016-04-06 11:28:35	jmarciano	ng0: I am fine, you are fine too I hope. thanks I am sorry for your feelings
2016-04-06 11:28:49	jmarciano	I would solve it myself, but I am not the boss
2016-04-06 11:29:06	Jookia	something nice about free software is that you can be your own boss and make your own guix
2016-04-06 11:29:11	jmarciano	if I need to rewrite something for all packages, I will do
2016-04-06 11:29:38	jmarciano	Jookia: sure I will think about that. Until then I wish that people in GuixSD know what they are doing in regards to respecting the GPL license.
2016-04-06 11:29:54	Jookia	i'm sure they know now
2016-04-06 11:30:31	kyamashita	Does anyone have USB auto-mount working in Thunar?

2016-04-06 11:33:22	davexunit	jackdaniel: thanks.  we have a number of European hackers here, including our maintainer, so perhaps we can send someone there!@
2016-04-06 11:33:32	kyamashita	Also wrong continent!
2016-04-06 11:33:45	davexunit	jackdaniel: is there a website or anything to register to be a speaker?
2016-04-06 11:33:53	davexunit	or a website for the conference at all?
2016-04-06 11:33:59	jackdaniel	great :) I was invited to do the presentation about managing packages in Common Lisp word and I thought about you
2016-04-06 11:34:18	jackdaniel	and the organiser told me, that he'd love to invite someone from guix, but don't know anyone

2016-04-06 11:34:50	Jookia	i wonder if i'm going overboard ith wanting things to be easy/out of the box in guix
2016-04-06 11:35:01	 *	davexunit sends an email to the list
2016-04-06 11:35:10	jackdaniel	thanks :)
2016-04-06 11:35:36	kyamashita	How easy do you want them to be, Jookia?
2016-04-06 11:35:52	lfam	They should be as easy as we make them ;)
2016-04-06 11:36:47	Jookia	kyamashita: I want to be able to do "guix environment --ad-hoc freepats timidity++ freedoom prboom+" and have freedoom load up on my machine ithout configuring WAD paths or MIDI soundfont paths
2016-04-06 11:38:11	Jookia	unfortunately it means patching to add search paths and configuration generators i think, though i don't know if profiles can generate config files?
2016-04-06 11:38:37	ng0	one last thing about the licenses today; I come from gentoo and still use it, and as problematic as gentoo is itself, they solved the licenses like this among other ways (solved == there might still be license missmatches, but that's it): https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/package.license
2016-04-06 11:38:55	kyamashita	Hm. That doesn't seem like you're going overboard, Jookia.
2016-04-06 11:39:12	ng0	and the folder listed there in /usr/ holds copies of all licenses
2016-04-06 11:39:35	Jookia	kyamashita: Maybe not so, but it's a little odd compared to imperative distros like Arch where you install and configure things systemide
2016-04-06 11:39:57	Jookia	kyamashita: If i wanted to use a different sound font or freedoom version i'd just need to change environments for example
2016-04-06 11:40:11	kyamashita	I see.
2016-04-06 11:40:32	Jookia	it'd also work on other distros which is nice :)
2016-04-06 11:42:41	Jookia	at this point i've kinda given up on packaging/configuring other distros
2016-04-06 11:42:53	ng0	it gets frustrating.
2016-04-06 11:43:15	kyamashita	GuixSD has been the easiest for me to configure and get the same thing each time.
2016-04-06 11:43:18	ng0	yesterday and today I ran into npm issues on gentoo and had another long list of packages to add to my own overlay
2016-04-06 11:43:27	Jookia	kyamashita: Woo! I'm glad
2016-04-06 11:43:30	ng0	where the long term sideproject guix on gentoo is much quicker
2016-04-06 11:44:07	lfam	kyamashita: I'm looking at your wmcpuload package definition. I don't understand what "current usage" in the description refers to. Is it literally the electrical current?
2016-04-06 11:44:31	ng0	language package managers create problems. I *can* use cargo, but I would prefer to install for example panopticon through emerge, and not cargo
2016-04-06 11:46:25	kyamashita	lfam: It was supposed to say "current CPU usage". It was taken from the home page slightly out of context.
2016-04-06 11:46:57	lfam	Okay, I'm going to apply the patch with that change, and a few other minor changes to the syntax and description (style and spelling changes)
2016-04-06 11:47:06	lfam	I mean, the synopsis and description
2016-04-06 11:48:37	kyamashita	Alright. I should read more of those for practice. Thanks for the review!

2016-04-06 12:00:46	lfam	I guess I should look into how libreboot configures its grub. I'm sure it's a video setting problem. The resolution is configured very low when the booting text shows after the grub menu times out. It only gets set sensibly once the kernel starts its framebuffer
2016-04-06 12:05:25	paroneayea	lfam: goofy
2016-04-06 12:05:47	df_	in case this didn't get answered (and sorry to dredge it up again): every debian package ships with a copyright file that explains the details of the licensing - generally one of more copyright headers that refer the user to the text of the licenses in /usr/share/common-licenses/
2016-04-06 12:06:27	ng0	df_: comparable to gentoo
2016-04-06 12:06:33	df_	it would be good for guixsd to have a simalar common-licenses package if it doesn't already
2016-04-06 12:06:39	ng0	only that debian adds a little extra
2016-04-06 12:07:48	df_	this "shipping with the license" argument is entirely orthogonal to the "corresponding source" one however, which fuels my suspicion that the originator is a troll out looking for problems

2016-04-06 12:11:33	df_	efraim: me too, and I'm really disappointed in the collective amount of time that has been wasted since
2016-04-06 12:12:03	kyamashita	The purpose of guix environment is to assist hackers in creating reproducible development environments without polluting their package profile. The guix environment tool takes one or more packages, builds all of their inputs, and creates a shell environment to use them.
2016-04-06 12:12:58	kyamashita	So you can develop for certain packages w/o having to constantly install and remove stuff to keep a clean environment.
2016-04-06 12:13:25	efraim	it's also good to run a program as a "one off" without installing it, like 'guix environment --ad-hoc abcde -- abcde' will add abcde to your path, run abcde, and then exit the environment
2016-04-06 12:13:39	efraim	also
2016-04-06 12:13:54	efraim	also `guix environment guix -- make` for the git repo
2016-04-06 12:13:57	lfam	And that is important in a month, when you need to run the garbage collector ;) Otherwise, all your in-progress packages that are in the history of your profiles will not be garbage collected unless you remove each offending profile, which is tedious
2016-04-06 12:14:20	efraim	guix package --roll-back
2016-04-06 12:14:38	kyamashita	efraim: nifty!
2016-04-06 12:15:43	lfam	--ad-hoc is amazing. I use it all the time
2016-04-06 12:16:06	 *	kyamashita adds --ad-hoc to toolbox
2016-04-06 12:17:40	lfam	Especially useful in conjunction with a fast caching mirror. I used it recently for libreoffice!

2016-04-06 12:21:49	rekado	Jookia: what do you think needs to be configured with Timidity?
2016-04-06 12:21:58	rekado	it's already preconfigured to use freepats.
2016-04-06 12:24:20	Jookia	how?
2016-04-06 12:24:26	-->	fhmgufs (~fhmgufs@unaffiliated/fhmgufs) has joined #guix
2016-04-06 12:27:09	rekado	we install a default config file that points to the freepats config
2016-04-06 12:27:30	rekado	see the "install-config" phase of the timidity++ package
2016-04-06 12:28:23	jmd	So I have a package which works perfectly under "guix environment" but fails under "guix environment --pure".  how do I find out what the difference is?
2016-04-06 12:29:34	lfam	The plain `guix environment` inherits your existing environment, whereas --pure unsets the existing environment.
2016-04-06 12:29:42	jmd	I know that.
2016-04-06 12:30:04	Jookia	rekado: Hmm- Doesn't work on my machine. What was this tested with?
2016-04-06 12:30:20	lfam	jmd: So, you could run `env` in each case, and then diff the results. At least, that's what I would do. There's probably a better method.
2016-04-06 12:30:54	rekado	Jookia: I tested it with plain timidity++ and a MIDI filie.
2016-04-06 12:30:57	rekado	file*
2016-04-06 12:31:02	rekado	I'm using it pretty often like that
2016-04-06 12:31:05	Jookia	rekado: Oh, so not timidity as a library?
2016-04-06 12:31:10	rekado	no.
2016-04-06 12:31:22	rekado	didn't know it can be used as a library
2016-04-06 12:31:28	jmd	lfam: I really need to examine the difference in the results.  env wont tell me much.
2016-04-06 12:31:39	Jookia	Well, all Doom ports I've tried use timidity++ to play MIDI tracks look in /etc/timidity.conf
2016-04-06 12:31:42	Jookia	.cfg*
2016-04-06 12:32:11	rekado	do they specifically pass this file name as an argument?
2016-04-06 12:32:30	mck	anyone been having trouble getting the texlive-texmf-2015 substitute? I always get a 503
2016-04-06 12:32:43	mck	building texlive from source... so slow
2016-04-06 12:32:46	rekado	we configure timidity to use its store directory's etc directory by default.
2016-04-06 12:33:00	rekado	mck: yeah, unfortunately there's no good way around this.
2016-04-06 12:33:00	Jookia	rekado: They don't from what I know
2016-04-06 12:33:20	rekado	mck: building from source is actually not so bad, it's mostly copying around stuff.
2016-04-06 12:33:43	rekado	Jookia: then it should use the default, which is the config file we provide in the "install-config" phase.
2016-04-06 12:33:59	kyamashita	mck: I've always gotten it when a substitute was available.
2016-04-06 12:34:02	Jookia	It's not
2016-04-06 12:34:17	mck	rekado: what do you mean by copying stuff around? is there some way around having guix download the tarball? because I can't ever seem to get that download to complete
2016-04-06 12:34:23	rekado	Jookia: do you see that it actually tries to access "/etc/timidity.conf"?
2016-04-06 12:34:29	rekado	e.g. in strace?
2016-04-06 12:34:33	Jookia	rekado: Yes, in the stderr of whatever ports
2016-04-06 12:34:41	rekado	Jookia: hmm.
2016-04-06 12:34:42	Jookia	rekado: Adding an /etc/timidity.cfg fixes it
2016-04-06 12:34:53	Jookia	I also have the relevant code that handles loading reference /etc/timidity.cfg
2016-04-06 12:35:03	rekado	Jookia: is that path used somewhere in the Doom sources?
2016-04-06 12:35:08	Jookia	No
2016-04-06 12:35:12	rekado	how odd.
2016-04-06 12:35:18	Jookia	It's used in timidity sources
2016-04-06 12:35:42	rekado	mck: no, I actually meant disabling substitutes for texlive-texmf-2015.
2016-04-06 12:35:52	lfam	jdm: In that case I would use the 'diffoscope' program.
2016-04-06 12:35:57	lfam	jmd ^
2016-04-06 12:36:38	Jookia	I'm surprised timidity is even working with this setup actually
2016-04-06 12:37:08	lfam	jmd: The likely issue is that your program is referring to something that isn't accounted for by Guix. For example, a library in /usr
2016-04-06 12:37:16	rekado	Jookia: why?
2016-04-06 12:37:28	anthk_	also the soundfonts
2016-04-06 12:37:30	anthk_	gm and gs
2016-04-06 12:37:36	lfam	jmd: That would explain why it works with `guix environment` and not with --pure
2016-04-06 12:37:43	rekado	anthk_: they are provided by freepats.
2016-04-06 12:37:53	rekado	it's not full gm coverage, though.
2016-04-06 12:37:57	Jookia	rekado: One sec
2016-04-06 12:41:25	Jookia	I was wrong, I can't actually find where it defines /etc/timidity.cfg
2016-04-06 12:41:38	mck	rekado: It should be able to invoke guix download on the tarball from a different, closer host, and be able to build texlive from source with guix build, right? I'm trying that now, anyway
2016-04-06 12:42:57	rekado	mck: currently we only have one build farm frontend: hydra.gnu.org.  And a single mirror: mirror.guixsd.org.
2016-04-06 12:43:25	jmd	lfam: Yes, that is my presumption too.  But it doesn't help me much.
2016-04-06 12:43:27	rekado	with the latest release the default is to check mirror.guixsd.org and then hydra.gnu.org IIRC.
2016-04-06 12:45:56	lfam	jmd: Sometimes I also run programs under strace to figure out these issues
2016-04-06 12:46:10	Jookia	uhoh, i have a sinking feeling i know whats happening
2016-04-06 12:46:33	Jookia	despite all being different source ports, they use timidity through sdl-mixer
2016-04-06 12:46:47	ng0	mirror.guixsd.org was gnunet ev sponsored, right? I am curious in the monthly stats of the server, inbound/outbound.. but maybe since 0.10 is not out that long I should ask in 2 weeks
2016-04-06 12:47:06	Jookia	:|
2016-04-06 12:47:13	Jookia	Well that's a lot more horrible than I expected
2016-04-06 12:47:22	Jookia	rekado: sdl_mixer bundles timidity
2016-04-06 12:48:04	rekado	argh!
2016-04-06 12:48:27	davexunit	Jookia: damn it.  it should allow for using a shared version
2016-04-06 12:48:33	Jookia	"[This version of timidity has been stripped for simplicity in porting to SDL]
2016-04-06 12:48:49	davexunit	well, if it's changed, than it's a fork
2016-04-06 12:48:53	rekado	the best way of bundling!
2016-04-06 12:49:00	Jookia	They've forked timidity then
2016-04-06 12:49:35	Jookia	... A 1995 version of Timidity
2016-04-06 12:49:54	ng0	that's the best fork, the older it is, the finer the fork
2016-04-06 12:50:04	lfam	Heirloom fork
2016-04-06 12:50:06	efraim	"from back in the day when it was good, not like today's version"
2016-04-06 12:50:10	Jookia	Haha
2016-04-06 12:50:13	rekado	:)
2016-04-06 12:50:25	ng0	i forked THING before everybody else.
2016-04-06 12:50:27	davexunit	rekado: in fairness, SDL 1.x is pretty damn old
2016-04-06 12:50:49	rekado	AFAIR there was a period in which timidity didn't see any releases.
2016-04-06 12:51:00	Jookia	yeah, it's not developed much
2016-04-06 12:51:03	rekado	is this actually timidity or timidity++?
2016-04-06 12:51:03	davexunit	also, sdl-mixer supports fluidsynth for MIDI
2016-04-06 12:51:12	Jookia	It's actually timidity, not timidity++
2016-04-06 12:51:13	davexunit	so why not just use that?
2016-04-06 12:51:19	davexunit	and disable timidity
2016-04-06 12:51:20	Jookia	davexunit: Does it bundle fluidsynth?
2016-04-06 12:51:20	rekado	yeah, fluidsynth is nicer.
2016-04-06 12:51:44	davexunit	Jookia: it might, but SDL_mixer lets you use shared versions
2016-04-06 12:51:44	Jookia	Would people get upset at tearing timidity support out of sdl-mixer and depending on fluidsynth?
2016-04-06 12:51:53	davexunit	no
2016-04-06 12:51:59	davexunit	unless it breaks software
2016-04-06 12:52:13	Jookia	SDL2's mixer has the same timidity code
2016-04-06 12:52:13	davexunit	I recall that building with fluidsynth had some issues
2016-04-06 12:52:22	davexunit	I maintain the SDL packages
2016-04-06 12:52:32	Jookia	I see
2016-04-06 12:52:50	davexunit	sdl-mixer doesn't bundle fluidsynth
2016-04-06 12:52:57	Jookia	Great
2016-04-06 12:53:22	davexunit	this timidity library is really small
2016-04-06 12:53:27	davexunit	so it seems rather harmless
2016-04-06 12:53:35	davexunit	I don't see the point of disabling it
2016-04-06 12:53:42	Jookia	Me either
2016-04-06 12:54:04	davexunit	but yeah, IIRC building with fluidsynth may have some issues to solve.
2016-04-06 12:54:22	<--	kyamashita (~kyamashit@reuben-kebreau-6.wireless.um.maine.edu) has left #guix ("Killed buffer")
2016-04-06 12:54:31	davexunit	make sure that sdl2 variants also build, since they inherit from the sdl 1.x versions
2016-04-06 12:54:44	Jookia	I want soundfonts to be available based on packages in a profile so I'm going to probably be patching timidity stuff and have a profile create a config, and do something like that for fluidsynth
2016-04-06 12:55:45	rekado	Jookia: sounds good!  For timidity I only used freepats because I couldn't find the original sources for the soundfonts I used.
2016-04-06 12:55:54	efraim	starting the X server didn't help with abiword's tests
2016-04-06 12:55:55	Jookia	Maybe soundfont packages should generate a config file that the profile uses and warns of collisions, meaning one soundfont per profile
2016-04-06 12:56:06	Jookia	rekado: FluidR3 has no sources?
2016-04-06 12:56:06	rekado	e.g. FluidR3GM.sf2 doesn't seem to have a proper upstream.
2016-04-06 12:56:11	Jookia	Hmm
2016-04-06 12:56:53	rekado	Jookia: also note that it's possible to use more than one soundfont as long as they are mapped to different instruments.
2016-04-06 12:57:02	rekado	not sure how to express this on the package level.
2016-04-06 12:57:08	davexunit	rekado: was it you that used microscheme for something?
2016-04-06 12:57:10	rekado	(maybe not at all)
2016-04-06 12:57:23	rekado	davexunit: yeah, I tried, but microscheme is extremely limited.
2016-04-06 12:57:24	rekado	no GC.
2016-04-06 12:57:25	davexunit	considering that it has an FFI, I might try to write some firmware with it.
2016-04-06 12:57:27	Jookia	rekado: I think that could be expressed by combining packages
2016-04-06 12:57:32	davexunit	rekado: yeah, it's not *really* Scheme.
2016-04-06 12:57:44	davexunit	maybe I'll just write plain C
2016-04-06 12:57:56	rekado	davexunit: I find it easier to write assembly than to use Scheme where I have to pay attention to its implementation details.
2016-04-06 12:58:06	 *	rekado --> zzZZ
2016-04-06 12:58:24	davexunit	yeah, make sense

2016-04-06 12:59:20	Jookia	I tried to learn but the lack of feedback made it difficult. Heh, I wonder if MAME's debugger could help
2016-04-06 12:59:31	Jookia	Me either
2016-04-06 13:01:38	davexunit	I understand the basic idea of moving stuff around in registers, changing the instruction pointer, etc., but I don't have much real practice
2016-04-06 13:01:45	davexunit	only stuff I did in a simulator years ago
2016-04-06 13:01:50	Jookia	davexunit: Do you think having a 'one soundfont per profile' rule to avoid doing too much application patching would be a good idea? The limitation here is that you'd have to make a new package to combine soundfonts (which would require soundfont knowledge anyway, dunno if it could be automated)
2016-04-06 13:01:59	efraim	oh, I saw in debian's repos that there's a C compiler targeting intel cpus from the 16/32 bit days
2016-04-06 13:02:14	davexunit	Jookia: not sure, sounds like something that shouldn't so limited.
2016-04-06 13:02:21	davexunit	or something that we shouldn't have to handle specially at all
2016-04-06 13:02:32	davexunit	I don't know what the techinical limitations are with sound fonts
2016-04-06 13:02:40	davexunit	so I can't really give an informed opinion
2016-04-06 13:03:47	Jookia	Mmm, maybe someone else will come up with a better idea. Not all synthesizers can deal with multiple soundfonts so putting them all in a profile would seem like a bad idea

2016-04-06 13:28:48	lfam	+1
2016-04-06 13:29:29	quiliro	lfam: ni
2016-04-06 13:29:31	quiliro	no
2016-04-06 13:29:52	lfam	What about davexunit's question?
2016-04-06 13:30:01	lfam	You shouldn't need to download anything from irssi.org
2016-04-06 13:30:42	quiliro	davexunit: oh you mean guixsd version....no 0.8.3 i think
2016-04-06 13:30:51	quiliro	i will download 0.10
2016-04-06 13:31:05	quiliro	but i am have spent 4 hours installing
2016-04-06 13:31:22	davexunit	quiliro: wow that explains a lot!
2016-04-06 13:31:32	quiliro	if i reboot i loose all that and have no internet connection in my town
2016-04-06 13:31:45	davexunit	quiliro: try just running 'guix pull' then
2016-04-06 13:32:05	davexunit	that should build the latest version of guix from source
2016-04-06 13:32:48	davexunit	quiliro: 0.8.3 is very old and we no longer provide binaries for that release, so that's why you see guix trying to download source code from irssi.org.  it is trying to build everything from source.
2016-04-06 13:34:03	quiliro	how long will it take to reinstall everything with 0.10?
2016-04-06 13:34:21	quiliro	in a core2 duo
2016-04-06 13:34:35	lfam	Much less time than building everything from 0.8.3 from source
2016-04-06 13:34:56	davexunit	yeah
2016-04-06 13:35:13	lfam	But I can't tell you exactly how long it will take. That depends on what packages you need and the speed of your network connection
2016-04-06 13:35:39	quiliro	400 kB/s average download
2016-04-06 13:35:51	lfam	That will still be much faster than building the entire system from source
2016-04-06 13:35:51	quiliro	desktop.scm
2016-04-06 13:36:04	lfam	Yes, *much* faster
2016-04-06 13:36:23	quiliro	i typed guix pull
2016-04-06 13:36:37	quiliro	should i just reboot with 0.10?
2016-04-06 13:36:59	quiliro	3 more minutes till completionof 0.10 download
2016-04-06 13:37:50	davexunit	yeah
2016-04-06 13:37:51	quiliro	master.tar.gz is downloading at 68KiB/s
2016-04-06 13:37:54	davexunit	probably faster
2016-04-06 13:38:45	quiliro	cool

2016-04-06 13:46:33	quiliro	davexunit: exactly
2016-04-06 13:47:38	quiliro	is there a way to make an offline a full destop installation of guixsd?

2016-04-06 13:48:27	quiliro	is there a way to make an offline full desktop installation of guixsd?
2016-04-06 13:48:38	davexunit	quiliro: if you have guix installed on any gnu/linux system, you can generate your own disk images
2016-04-06 13:48:42	lfam	Sure, you could use `guix system disk-image` to create a live image of the system. That's actually how we make the installer
2016-04-06 13:48:47	davexunit	+1
2016-04-06 13:48:54	quiliro	with the desktop.scm file defaults

2016-04-06 13:49:28	anthk_	I have no words .
2016-04-06 13:49:47	quiliro	that easy?
2016-04-06 13:49:48	lfam	quiliro: Something like this: `guix system disk-image --image-size=10000MiB desktop.scm`
2016-04-06 13:50:28	lfam	quiliro: You'd want to add '--fallback' to that
2016-04-06 13:50:43	lfam	Then, you can take the result and put it on a USB stick and boot from that
2016-04-06 13:51:16	quiliro	a live system can be made from my installed system and that live system does not need to be online to install the same system i had on the machine that created the live system?
2016-04-06 13:52:16	lfam	You can make the live system from your installed system. I'm not sure how to install that live system onto a machine, but I'm sure it's possible.
2016-04-06 13:52:38	quiliro	guix system disk-image --image-size=1G gnu/system/install.scm
2016-04-06 13:52:43	quiliro	is that it?
2016-04-06 13:53:00	quiliro	what is fallback for?
2016-04-06 13:53:07	quiliro	lfam: ^
2016-04-06 13:53:15	lfam	Fallback will build from source if the binary download doesn't work
2016-04-06 13:53:25	quiliro	oh!!!!
2016-04-06 13:53:32	lfam	The command line you show is how we build the GuixSD installer
2016-04-06 13:53:39	lfam	That's what 'gnu/system/install.scm' is
2016-04-06 13:53:44	quiliro	but i need the oposite
2016-04-06 13:53:57	lfam	So, you'd probably want to use a different .scm file, and probably increase the image-size
2016-04-06 13:54:06	lfam	The opposite of what?
2016-04-06 13:54:13	quiliro	install binary from usb not downloaded
2016-04-06 13:54:31	lfam	Right, I keep forgetting you want to do it offline
2016-04-06 13:54:36	lfam	In that case, it will have no effecet
2016-04-06 13:54:37	lfam	effect
2016-04-06 13:54:42	quiliro	that is what i need because i will be installing in rural areas...besides i have no internet in my area
2016-04-06 13:54:50	lfam	It won't matter, because you'll have all the packages already on your computer
2016-04-06 13:55:26	lfam	Can you send this question to help-guix@gnu.org? I'd like to document this process, and it would be useful to have the discussion via email
2016-04-06 13:56:32	lfam	And somebody there may have better advice
2016-04-06 13:57:37	quiliro	lfam: cool
2016-04-06 13:59:44	quiliro	lfam: it will be easier for me once it is installed on my machine
2016-04-06 14:00:21	quiliro	will my old desshould i erase my /mnt?
2016-04-06 14:00:28	lfam	davexunit: Do you think quiliro could `dd` the live USB desktop image to a machine in order to install it?
2016-04-06 14:00:31	quiliro	sorry
2016-04-06 14:00:43	quiliro	should i erse my olÃ§d /mnt
2016-04-06 14:00:45	quiliro	?
2016-04-06 14:02:13	lfam	I'm not sure.
2016-04-06 14:02:35	lfam	Whatever is left over from when you tried to install 0.8.3 is not needed anymore.

2016-04-06 14:33:57	bavier	quiliro: maybe there's a different kernel module that needs to be loaded?

2016-04-06 16:05:45	lfam	Just 'sdb'?
2016-04-06 16:05:45	quiliro	but when removing the usb there is only one disk
2016-04-06 16:06:16	quiliro	i dont remember
2016-04-06 16:06:28	quiliro	now i remember
2016-04-06 16:06:48	quiliro	it asked label and device
2016-04-06 16:07:36	lfam	Here is what works for me: http://paste.lisp.org/+6P8P
2016-04-06 16:08:06	lfam	I made sure to set the label of the partition when creating the filesystem, like this: `mkfs.ext4 -L my-root /dev/sda1`
2016-04-06 16:08:21	quiliro	i did that too
2016-04-06 16:08:27	lfam	Of course, whether it's sda or sdb depends on your system
2016-04-06 16:08:28	quiliro	in fact the label is raiz
2016-04-06 16:08:49	quiliro	but i put sdb because it was sdb at the time
2016-04-06 16:09:05	quiliro	now te usb is removed and it is sda probably
2016-04-06 16:09:10	quiliro	how can i boot
2016-04-06 16:09:16	quiliro	to change this?
2016-04-06 16:09:59	lfam	Is the system still running or did you halt / reboot?
2016-04-06 16:10:23	quiliro	i rebooted
2016-04-06 16:10:32	quiliro	and got the guile prompt
2016-04-06 16:10:42	quiliro	scm-error
2016-04-06 16:11:00	lfam	I would reboot again from the USB, and then inspect the partitions of the computer to see if they match what is expected.
2016-04-06 16:12:09	quiliro	if i change desktop.scm to sda will it boot?
2016-04-06 16:12:18	quiliro	lfam: ^
2016-04-06 16:13:04	lfam	Well, you'll have to reconfigure the system to use the correct device and partition. If you can't boot the machine, we'll have to figure out how to do that from the Guile prompt
2016-04-06 16:15:08	quiliro	lfam: how do i reconfigure
2016-04-06 16:15:14	quiliro	i am rebooting now
2016-04-06 16:15:40	lfam	Normally you reconfigure like this: `guix system reconfigure path/to/desktop.scm`. But if you can't boot, it's complicated.

2016-04-06 17:21:19	iyzsong	that's confusing, I think what you did is right, when install the 'grub-configuration' should be '/dev/sdb', so that the bootloader will be installed.
2016-04-06 17:22:48	quiliro	but it will not recognize it when it changes to sda

2016-04-06 17:24:00	iyzsong	yes, if in the live usb, the hard disk is sdb, I think you should use usb.  after boot from harddisk, do a reconfigure to change it to sda.

2016-04-07 04:39:23	efraim	I find 1 patch per email message easier to read, might as well send them all it in one go
2016-04-07 04:43:52	roelj	I think it'll be a kind of flood to the mailing list..
2016-04-07 04:44:06	suitsmeveryfine	efraim: the build fails so I can't ignore the warnings.
2016-04-07 04:45:36	suitsmeveryfine	efraim: Is it likely that I need to use an older version of GCC? The README says that it has been confirmed to compile with GCC v. 3.3 - 4.4, 4.6 - 4.8

2016-04-07 04:48:23	wingo	roelj: 1 patch per mail is better i think; lets reviewers process it in chunks and lets you know feedback per-patch
2016-04-07 04:49:25	roelj	wingo: Are you sure about that? It's 45 mails then.. :)
2016-04-07 04:49:34	wingo	it's happened before :)
2016-04-07 04:49:38	roelj	Cool
2016-04-07 04:50:00	wingo	git-send-email can do it for you, and readers can kill threads
2016-04-07 04:50:43	spudowiar	efraim: my current solution is to symlink `/usr/bin/env` to `/run/current-system/profile/bin/env`
2016-04-07 04:51:23	roelj	wingo: But then the mail only contains the patch.  Is that OK?
2016-04-07 04:52:44	wingo	roelj: not a problem, the patches will be numbered and threaded by git-send-email
2016-04-07 04:53:02	roelj	Ok. Thanks :)
2016-04-07 04:53:13	wingo	and you can edit a "main" message
2016-04-07 04:53:20	wingo	see the git-send-email man page
2016-04-07 04:53:51	roelj	Do you have some pro tip for separating the chunks into commits as well? Most packages are in the same file..
2016-04-07 04:54:37	wingo	no real pro-tip there, besides using staging in magit
2016-04-07 04:54:51	wingo	but if the lines are all contiguous, magit might see it all as one hunk
2016-04-07 04:55:19	spudowiar	Also, how do I add globally-visible packages to my system?
2016-04-07 04:55:27	spudowiar	Do I copy config.scm, modify it and `guix system reconfigure`?

2016-04-07 05:03:02	suitsmeveryfine	Hmm, downgrading GCC had no effect.  I don't even know where "--enable-fast-install" is coming from; it's not in `configure` or any of the helpers.
2016-04-07 05:06:43	iyzsong	it's in the configure phase of the gnu-build-system, here you should replace it.
2016-04-07 05:10:20	suitsmeveryfine	iyzsong: I see. Should I do this by adding something like this: "(arguments `(#:configure-flags '("--xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"))"?
2016-04-07 05:11:04	efraim	(arguments (modify-phases %standard-phases (replace 'configure
2016-04-07 05:11:22	efraim	er, (arguments `(#:phases (modify...
2016-04-07 05:12:14	iyzsong	yes, the #:configure-flags is add to (not replace) the default flags.
2016-04-07 05:12:55	suitsmeveryfine	OK, so what whould be the full line to remove "--enable-fast-install"?

2016-04-07 05:15:29	iyzsong	suitsmeveryfine: just replace the 'configure phase, look the 'samba' package for example.

2016-04-07 05:17:43	iyzsong	wingo: thanks for the guide on 'edit-expression'!   also I wonder if the byte position can be recorded in source-properties ..
2016-04-07 05:21:50	suitsmeveryfine	iyzsong: I'm looking at the 'samba' package but there are things added below "(replace 'configure".
2016-04-07 05:22:30	wingo	iyzsong: that would be possible but would require a change in Guile and (currently) an ftell() before every read
2016-04-07 05:22:35	wingo	so probably not a short-term thing
2016-04-07 05:22:51	spudowiar	wingo: should I not replace /etc/config.scm?
2016-04-07 05:23:03	wingo	spudowiar: i don't remember how that works :)
2016-04-07 05:23:10	iyzsong	oh, that sound too heavy :-
2016-04-07 05:23:23	wingo	i think i started using guixsd before it installed the config into /etc
2016-04-07 05:23:27	wingo	so i don't know how that works
2016-04-07 05:24:20	iyzsong	suitsmeveryfine: yes, you need call the 'configure' script using 'system*', and pass the desired flags.
2016-04-07 05:24:37	spudowiar	wingo: I guess I'll just read the source code
2016-04-07 05:25:20	spudowiar	wingo: AFAICT config.scm means nothing
2016-04-07 05:25:28	wingo	iyzsong: one more thing i forgot -- the argument to get-string-n isn't bytes
2016-04-07 05:25:50	iyzsong	there is no /etc/config.scm on my system.  I put and manage my config.scm in /etc/guix.
2016-04-07 05:25:50	wingo	so probably to be correct you should use get-bytevector-n and then convert to a string
2016-04-07 05:25:59	suitsmeveryfine	iyzsong: these are the configure flags that were called automatically: "configure flags: ("CONFIG_SHELL=/gnu/store/b1yqjimbdh5bf9jnizd4h7yf110744j2-bash-4.3.42/bin/bash" "SHELL=/gnu/store/b1yqjimbdh5bf9jnizd4h7yf110744j2-bash-4.3.42/bin/bash" "--prefix=/gnu/store/yglqy6ahpljdfjskznjrbmw1sj1d2252-openttd-1.6.0" "--enable-fast-install" "--build=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu")"
2016-04-07 05:27:19	suitsmeveryfine	So you're saying that I would need to add all of these except "--enable-fast-install".
2016-04-07 05:27:30	spudowiar	iyzsong: yeah, the installation says to create one but AFAICT, it's stored there just for reference
2016-04-07 05:27:43	spudowiar	The only thing is that it's made read only
2016-04-07 05:27:55	spudowiar	So I just `chmod 644 /etc/config.scm` :P
2016-04-07 05:28:54	iyzsong	ok :-)
2016-04-07 05:30:08	spudowiar	Anyway, I'm new to Lisp, so I might be on here quite often
2016-04-07 05:30:11	iyzsong	suitsmeveryfine: you can figure them out by run the 'configure' script manually in 'guix environment', etc.
2016-04-07 05:34:58	suitsmeveryfine	iyzsong: OK -- when I do this I get an output like this: "checking build system type... x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu [...] checking build cc... gcc [...] detecting SSE... found [...] configure: error: no video driver development files found"
2016-04-07 05:37:53	spudowiar	wingo: how do I list all herd services? I'm trying to restart sshd (lsh)
2016-04-07 05:37:55	suitsmeveryfine	Ah, I get a long list of flags after running `./configure --help`
2016-04-07 05:38:12	wingo	spudowiar: sudo herd status shepherd i think

2016-04-07 05:47:16	ngz	Hello.
2016-04-07 05:48:59	ngz	I have a question about package creation. I wrote a new package definition in GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH and successfully installed it in the store. Now I'm trying to send a patch for inclusion. I pasted the definition in the appropriate module in /gnu/. How can I check if it is still correct (e.g., there is no missing use-module at the beginning of the module)?

2016-04-07 05:52:51	df_	compile it?
2016-04-07 05:53:37	roelj	ngz: Set GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH to "" (blank), then compile the Guix source with your new package definition. Then install it using Guix.
2016-04-07 05:56:21	ngz	df_: That's what I would like to do, but I don't know how. I'm not using the repository as my guix installation.
2016-04-07 05:57:22	ngz	roelj: How do you "compile the Guix source"?
2016-04-07 05:57:48	df_	well... do that?  you can run your development version without messing up the rest of the system by using preinst-env
2016-04-07 05:58:20	-->	jmd (~user@de.cellform.com) has joined #guix
2016-04-07 05:59:12	roelj	ngz: For that you need to check out the Guix git repository, and then just autoreconf -i; ./configure; make
2016-04-07 05:59:30	jmd	http://www.gnu.org/software/guix/package-list.html is too large.  It needs to be split up or made dynamic.
2016-04-07 06:00:28	df_	that's a good problem to have...
2016-04-07 06:01:01	jmd	But a bad problem to ignore.
2016-04-07 06:03:14	davexunit	it should stay static.
2016-04-07 06:03:17	davexunit	just needs pagination
2016-04-07 06:03:23	ngz	roelj: Thank you. Do I have to do this each time I pull from the git repository?
2016-04-07 06:03:25	davexunit	we cannot host dynamic web applications on gnu.org anyway
2016-04-07 06:05:32	roelj	ngz: Well, what I do is this: 1. 'git pull' to get the latest changes; 2. Add my package; 3. Test my changes; 4. Commit the changes; 5. Run 'git format-patch -1 --no-attach' to create a patch file; 6. E-mail the patch file to the mailing list.
2016-04-07 06:06:32	ngz	roelj: Actually, as I tried to explain, the third point is giving me headaches. I'm fine with the others, tho :)
2016-04-07 06:06:46	roelj	ngz: If you make a symbolic link in $HOME/.config/guix/latest that points to your Git repository directory, then you'll be able to test your changes.

2016-04-07 07:14:08	Jookia	anthk_: is marrub on IRC? or is there a gloom channel?
2016-04-07 07:14:13	anthk_	Jookia, "All of the code from Doom has been relicensed from the Doom Software License to the GPL license, and all legally troubled code (such as the code taken from Ken Silverman's BUILD engine) have been either removed or rewritten and licensed to be GPL compatible."
2016-04-07 07:14:20	anthk_	Jookia,  marrub on github
2016-04-07 07:14:25	Jookia	i don't use github
2016-04-07 07:14:32	anthk_	https://github.com/marrub--
2016-04-07 07:16:46	anthk_	altough prboom-plus is good enough for FreeDoom
2016-04-07 07:17:11	Jookia	yeah
2016-04-07 07:17:11	anthk_	gloome is just suited for most z-doom source PWADS, and sadly most of them have non-free ACS code
2016-04-07 07:17:30	Jookia	odamex is based on zdoom and is GPL compatible (no voxel code either)
2016-04-07 07:17:36	anthk_	prboom compatible PWADS are fine too
2016-04-07 07:17:44	roelj	What package provides "sh"?

2016-04-07 07:20:40	anthk_	altough I could use diff -u
2016-04-07 07:26:51	Jookia	anthk_: know any doom ports with openal support?
2016-04-07 07:37:27	anthk_	Jookia, why do you need openal?
2016-04-07 07:37:47	anthk_	prboom-plus has different sound backends such as SDL, fluidsynth, timidity...
2016-04-07 07:37:49	Jookia	i don't NEED it, but it'd be nice to have hrtf support
2016-04-07 07:37:56	Jookia	just for fun
2016-04-07 07:38:04	anthk_	positional audio
2016-04-07 07:38:10	anthk_	somehow I knew it :P
2016-04-07 07:38:12	anthk_	but
2016-04-07 07:38:33	anthk_	vavoom has openal support I think
2016-04-07 07:39:42	Jookia	i think doomsday engine does too

2016-04-07 09:23:50	bavier	there are other examples of this
2016-04-07 09:24:03	bavier	I can find one... just a sec
2016-04-07 09:25:09	suitsmeveryfine	bavier: yes, other people suggested this to me earlier. The trouble is that I don't know which options to add.  That's why I asked earlier if there's a way to remove a particular option rather than defining all the options manually.

2016-04-07 09:27:53	alezost	suitsmeveryfine: I think it's better to make a custom configure phase.  If you grep for --enable-fast-install in "gnu/packages" dir, you'll find something

2016-04-07 15:02:01	mark_weaver	so maybe you want that as an input, or maybe the package really wants python-2 instead.
2016-04-07 15:02:20	rain1	btw mark_weaver, I could not fixup blender to work with the new ffmpeg - it required a new python, but python does not compile (need to wait for them to fix that)
2016-04-07 15:02:53	mark_weaver	rain1: what required a new python?
2016-04-07 15:03:06	rain1	the newer version of blender, to work with newer ffmpeg
2016-04-07 15:04:36	mark_weaver	I guess we should cherry-pick / backport the changes to blender needed for the new ffmpeg.

2016-04-07 15:04:48	mark_weaver	so we get those fixes without the requirement for new python.
2016-04-07 15:08:29	mthl	mark_weaver: Thanks again for your explication, using 'python-wrapper' has fixed the issue and shorten my package definition.
