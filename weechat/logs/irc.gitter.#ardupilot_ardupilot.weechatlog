2016-03-31 15:21:39	Elios007	@magicrub does the crash detect work for the fixed wings plane and also there was no crash. We have landed with the parachute but we are not using the pixhawk Parachute system so the motor was still enable and we lost the esc and motors.

2016-03-31 23:06:20	magicrub	The parachute feature is the best solution for this since the crash detection was not intended for this use. However it may work fine but not reliably.

2016-03-31 23:16:21	WickedShell	The other option is that you can mix you're parachute trigger RC signal to also force the AP into manual. (Integrated parachute options are still better)

2016-04-01 01:00:59	Elios007	@WickedShell @magicrub the crash detection will not work good if we pulled the parachute at 100m if emergency, especially if there was wind because the airspeed and ground speed will not be very low. I guess the best option for the moment will be an electronic switch to turn off the esc if our rc controller was not able to mix between the parachute trigger and force AP to change manual.
2016-04-01 01:00:59	Elios007	I know the best option is the the parachute feature but its issue for the moment it will not allow you to precheck the parachute mechanism before the flight as it will understand that the mission has finished.

2016-04-02 06:49:09	Efekkt	@trondhindenes I haven't been able to get it to work. The takeoff command in the example works but send_ned_velocity and send_global_velocity gives no response when I test without props on, the messages will print after the set duration but no motor response. I am on the latest release of Arducopter through mission planner and I am using a Raspberry Pi 2 as the companion computer. Any good

2016-04-02 20:17:52	mw46d	Hello, I have a strange problem with my PixHawk & APMrover:-( My compiled (git up to date) version causes the double-yellow pre-arm fail:-( Mission Planner only reports `Bad AHRS', everything else looks reasonable. Loading the latest `released' APMrover FW via Mission Planner and things seem to work better:-( Is there a way to find out which pre-arm test failed?

2016-04-02 21:18:58	magicrub	@Elios007 I wrote all the crash detection, it is probabilily based and relies heavily on airspeed and groundspeed. Shock is just an input to lose probability faster if it feels a larger deceleration, which may still happen on a parachute release so it works in your favor. Please give it a try. Again, the parachute feature is still the best option. If it needs to change behaviour to accommodate
2016-04-02 21:18:58	magicrub	preflight checks then please create an issue so we can add it to the to-do list.

2016-04-02 21:55:20	mw46d	something is strange with the arming check for me:-( When I turn it of (ARMING_CHECK set to 0), the double yellow goes away as expected, but when I set it to 4 (only GPS check), it's blinking double yellow again even when I have a GPS 3D lock ?! 
2016-04-02 22:03:42	WickedShell	Check the arming message, it's probably because it is failing to verify the DPS driver settings, or is looking for an extra GPS that isn't connected
2016-04-02 22:22:15	mw46d	it seems to be the second GPS 
2016-04-02 22:22:39	mw46d	I tried to disable it in the pixhawk but was not successful yet
2016-04-02 22:23:27	mw46d	but when I  use a check value of 2 (compass), it's ok.
2016-04-02 22:23:42	mw46d	as soon as I enable the gps check, the blinking starts
2016-04-02 22:27:44	WickedShell	Set GPS_TYPE2 = 0
2016-04-02 22:30:51	mw46d	yes
2016-04-02 22:31:08	mw46d	and I was one bit off in my reading:-(
2016-04-02 22:36:45	mw46d	ok, I seem to have problems with the compass and the battery voltage (right now on USB power;-)
2016-04-02 22:37:06	mw46d	turning one bit on at the time
2016-04-02 22:49:38	mw46d	next problem, when I tried to calibrate my two compasses, one had offsets way outside of the expected range?!:-(
2016-04-02 22:49:45	mw46d	What can I do about that?

2016-04-03 18:10:29	tridge	I have disabled the use of EKF1 in master for plane. We were just too close to the 1MByte limit
2016-04-03 18:13:09	OXINARF	@tridge or @rmackay9 Travis is consistently failing the fly_stability_patch test in Arducopter, I'm not sure if it is craziness from Travis, but it usually doesn't always fail the SITL test like it is doing now (and I had never seen it fail this specific test before)
2016-04-03 18:14:16	tridge	@OXINARF that is probably a result of the new AP_Motors code
2016-04-03 18:15:40	OXINARF	@tridge That's what I though, but do you think it's the test that doesn't work correctly now or something is wrong in AP_Motors code?
2016-04-03 18:16:14	tridge	don't know. I did fix a sitl bug related to SIM_ENGINE_MUL recently
2016-04-03 18:18:48	OXINARF	I know, that's actually when the test started to fail. I'm not sure if it's because of that specific commit because Travis combined multiple commits to test
2016-04-03 18:23:08	tridge	it could be this change too: https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/commit/7dcd17a2fa31b9dab5dbb695e929e192421f49f4
2016-04-03 18:24:31	tridge	with that change the copter can't actually stay in the air with one motor at 55%
2016-04-03 18:25:11	OXINARF	Yes, sorry, that's the change I was looking at, not the SIM_ENGINE_MUL
2016-04-03 18:26:10	OXINARF	So, it's the test that should be modified right?
2016-04-03 18:27:56	tridge	yep, we need to make it 60% now
2016-04-03 18:28:24	OXINARF	Will you do it or do you want me to do a PR?

2016-04-03 21:17:29	badfirefly	dont understand the “spare_ticks” in  schedule.run, anyone help me?
2016-04-03 21:18:59	badfirefly	@tridge why disable EKF1?
2016-04-03 21:19:20	peterbarker	@badfirefly He did state; needed the flash space.
2016-04-03 21:19:36	peterbarker	Experience indicates EKF2 is a strict improvement.
2016-04-03 21:25:58	peterbarker	@badfirefly Looks like spare_ticks is used to help age-out the accumulated number of microseconds that have been left after a scheduler run.  Not sure what sort of decay function this gives you, but it saves having to remember microseconds left over from multiple scheduler runs so you can do an average.
2016-04-03 22:19:49	badfirefly	@peterbarker tks! But not well understand yet!

2016-04-04 21:26:49	peterbarker	Be wary with that, BTW.  I've heard that MEMS devices can be permanently damaged if you overwhelm them.  So keep those neodymiums well clear....
2016-04-04 21:27:00	tridge	MAVLink2 PR is ready for review for anyone feeling brave: https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/pull/3859
2016-04-04 21:27:58	mw46d	the other problem with the prearm checks was that the rover code called it always with `report == false' I changed the code a bit to report the warnings every 30 seconds (like the copter code) 
2016-04-04 21:28:15	peterbarker	Great!  PR it?
2016-04-04 21:28:45	mw46d	I'll come back to that after the weekend:-(
2016-04-04 21:29:12	mw46d	first I'll have to get things working for the RoboMagellan @ robogames.net ;-)
2016-04-04 21:29:29	peterbarker	What *are* you mounting this on?
2016-04-04 21:30:03	mw46d	I've also update the AP_GPS_NMEA to report more/differenbt than just 3d_fix

2016-04-04 21:32:07	peterbarker	Cool.  Combination of GPS and sonar?
2016-04-04 21:33:02	mw46d	GPS (two, hopefully one RTK), sonar (two) & webcam image processing (using an Odroid U3)
2016-04-04 21:35:03	mw46d	basically Pixhawk/APmrover2 <-> U3 (ROS/mavros) 
2016-04-04 21:38:51	mw46d	I did not really find a way to feed GPS fix data to the PixHawk via the mavlink connection:-( So I have currently two connections between the PixHawk and the U3, one doing the telemetry/mavlink and the other acting as GPS2 ;-)
2016-04-04 21:40:48	peterbarker	Heh.  I don't think there is a way to pass in GPS position information using mavlink.  It would be interesting to add a AP_GPS_MAVLINK object which could listen for position information from another vehicle and repeat it as GPS data.
2016-04-04 21:41:32	peterbarker	[edit] Heh.  I don't think there is a way to pass in GPS position information using mavlink.  It would be interesting to add a AP_GPS_MAVLINK object which could listen for position information from another vehicle and repeat it as GPS sensor data.
2016-04-04 21:41:55	peterbarker	Not sure that's going to be a common use case :-)
2016-04-04 21:42:16	mw46d	It's not just another vehicle, my U3 `companion computer' sits on the same and does the RTKLIB (rtklib.com) calculations 
2016-04-04 21:42:37	mw46d	so I would have liked a way to feed that to the PixHawk
2016-04-04 21:43:55	peterbarker	Yep. I really mean "mavlink system" by "vehicle".  Hmmm.
2016-04-04 21:44:09	peterbarker	You *can* feed RTK correction stuff into the PixHawk via mavlink.
2016-04-04 21:44:36	mw46d	the ubox m8t's are not that expensive any more;-) but you need something to to all the work. 
2016-04-04 21:46:34	mw46d	the problem is that most `consumer GPS receivers' don't to real RTK. you can find modules which use an Intel Edison or something and take the raw receiver data 
2016-04-04 21:46:55	peterbarker	I assume you've looked through tridge's stuff from way-back-when?
2016-04-04 21:46:58	mw46d	I had the U3 and I think it can do it along with the little image process

2016-04-04 21:47:57	peterbarker	The RTK stuff is going to be of interest to us soon for the Outback Challenge, so it's nice to see someone working with it.
2016-04-04 21:50:48	mw46d	the normal ublox M8N's can only use some RTMC2 messages and that would be limited to GPS. With my current setup, I can send the data for GPS/SBAS/GLONASS/Galileo satellites from the base station and hopefully can use most of it;-)

2016-04-05 00:18:43	hamishwillee	@lvale  I strongly disagree. It is very user friendly, and in particular much more than Wordpress was. The syntax is very simple to learn and the environment trivially easy to set up. If you can't be bothered setting up that environment you can still see whether things will render or not in github. 
2016-04-05 00:19:54	hamishwillee	Could it be better? Well yes, if I'd set this up using Confluence or Mediawiki we might have been able to have an even more user friendly system and still meet the "security" requirements. But someone would still complain the syntax wasn't X, Y, or Z, and you'd still have a lot of maintenance.

2016-04-05 00:54:18	naktinis	Does anyone know how ALT_OFFSET is incorporated into altitude calculation in Plane? For target altitude, `target_relative_to_home_altitude = target_altitude.amsl_cm - home.alt + alt_offset_cm` (note the plus sign in front of alt_offset_cm). However, for current plane's altitude, `current_relative_to_home_altitude = current_loc.alt - home.alt - alt_offset_cm` (note the plus sign). Why is it so? Is this a bug?

Yeah, I want to try that in the next week and see what improvements we can get. @lucasdemarchi said that  when it was tried before it didn't brought any significant improvement. Last week I tried to use the beta Trusty environment (because it has 2 CPUs vs our actual 1.5) but there wasn't any change in times

2016-04-05 15:59:32	UaviaDrones	Hi guys ! I've been trying some post 3.3.3 software recently and stumbled upon very strange behavior in Loiter. A few seconds after switching to Loiter, copter banks and ends up crashing if not manually recovered. See video here : https://slack-files.com/T02TDS68E-F0Y4K7KMM-2cde2a6a20 and log here : https://slack-files.com/T02TDS68E-F0Y4C7UPR-bbfefd7a99
2016-04-05 16:00:07	UaviaDrones	If somebody could take a look at the log - haven't seen anything suspicious so far (vibes ok, etc...).
2016-04-05 16:00:11	UaviaDrones	Thanks !

2016-04-05 16:10:54	peterbarker	Having a bit of a look ATM.  First thing I spotted was massive compass vector length on MAG2.

2016-04-05 16:16:49	peterbarker	EKF does register this in its compass variance.
2016-04-05 16:18:59	peterbarker	However, this happens later in the flight.  EKF goes unhappy 3000us after arming.  That's bad.
2016-04-05 16:26:03	peterbarker	Note that ATT.Roll is following ATT.DesRoll reasonably well.  So this was commanded.

2016-04-05 16:40:40	peterbarker	@UaviaDrones  EKF4's magnetic innovations correlate pretty directly with the wandering off-course it did.  I think your second magnetometer is too close to current-carrying wires and is being adversely affected by it.  You might try calibrating that out, but it would be better if you could move them apart.

2016-04-06 05:07:43	UaviaDrones	@peterbarker Just did a quick test. Problems seem to come from MAG2 (which is Pixhawk's internal compass). So I've decided so disable MAG2 and just leave MAG1 (which looks to be allright, with a correct mag length). Same behavior :(

2016-04-06 08:45:21	AntMaan	Hey guys, was hoping to get some insight here on some MAVLink message generating.  I am running ./libraries/GCS_MAVLink/generate.sh and I expect to only see my new message header file. Unfortunately all of the message headers change because of the way they are being generated. When I pull from ardupilot, I have a comment style '///'.  However, when I re-generate to add my new messages,
2016-04-06 08:45:21	AntMaan	I get a comment style of '/* */'.  I would like to avoid having these changes so that I have less issues tracking the upstream.  Plus its just messy.  Is there some setting that needs to be configured?  I tried digging in a little bit but am a little confused on where generate.sh even comes from.  On the ardupilot repo in libraries/GCS_MAVLink, generate.sh doesn't exist.  Then I thought
2016-04-06 08:45:21	AntMaan	it was getting pulled in from the mavlink submodule. Nope not there either.  Hope you guys can help!
2016-04-06 08:46:00	AntMaan	Sorry, guess the /\* needed an escape sequence
2016-04-06 08:46:20	AntMaan	The comment style I get is '/\* \*/'

Seems to be the python em module doesn't have Interpreter. Never had this issue before (I'm installing on a fresh computer). Any ideas?

2016-04-06 17:32:07	AntMaan	@OXINARF  @magicrub Okay so I should not be calling generate.sh.  And I theoretically shouldn't have this file in the folder. (I'm going to do a bit of testing to see how I got it). Lastly,
2016-04-06 17:32:27	AntMaan	when we're those changes made? I am working off of the Copter-3.3 branch

2016-04-06 18:40:07	AntMaan	Okay, so I don't know how I didn't put this together before, but the Copter-3.3 branch is the one that still has the generate.sh file in it.  Having said that I think here are the remaining questions I have.  On the Copter-3.3 branch A) Do we update Mavlink using generate.sh? B) Is there a way (assuming generate.sh is used) to change the comment style used?
2016-04-06 19:07:03	OXINARF	@AntMaan Yes, in the 3.3. branch that file still exists and yes, that was the file used to generate new headers. Regarding the comments I don't know why you are seeing different styles, maybe some change in generator?
