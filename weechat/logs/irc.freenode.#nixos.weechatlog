2016-03-29 12:38:21	pikajude	`with foo; expression` basically binds a bunch of variables that correspond to the key/value pairs of `foo`

2016-03-29 12:38:40	pikajude	right
2016-03-29 12:38:44	iri	the problem is knowing that `pkgs` is in scope
2016-03-29 12:39:29	copumpkin	did nix use sha-1 hashing at some point for store paths?

2016-03-29 12:44:16	ktosiek	equalizer is a sink

2016-03-29 12:45:34	manveru	isn't that just what nix-shell -p does?
2016-03-29 12:45:43	ktosiek	you need a wrapper for the qpaeq that sets the python path
2016-03-29 12:46:06	ktosiek	kind of, but that's the difference between build environment and using the build output :-)

2016-03-29 14:21:39	keb	how many entries
2016-03-29 14:21:44	nschoe_	Now it works, I ran nixos-rebuild switch and it built and booted in the newly-created state, but I have essentially ruined any chance to rollback
2016-03-29 14:22:09	nschoe_	Well now I dno't have any choice: I have only one entry left, my latest, current one :/
2016-03-29 14:22:21	nschoe_	But it works, so... I guess I'll start from here
2016-03-29 14:22:32	keb	well you can always use /nix/var/nix/profiles/system-NN-link/activate
2016-03-29 14:22:44	keb	as long as you have just 1 bootable profile
2016-03-29 14:22:48	nschoe_	I think I played a bit too much with the "-d" option of nix-collect-garbage, but then I don't know what it does apparently
2016-03-29 14:22:58	keb	that deletes them all lol
2016-03-29 14:23:12	nschoe_	keb: ah! this explains it then
2016-03-29 14:23:28	meloc	:q
2016-03-29 14:23:32	nschoe_	I have only /nix/var/nix/profiles/system-36-link (since I run -d apparently)
2016-03-29 14:23:34	keb	use nix-env --delete-generations to select them individually
2016-03-29 14:23:47	keb	why are you concerned you need rollback?
2016-03-29 14:23:57	nschoe_	keb, well I did that first, then I ran nix-collect-garbage -d :/
2016-03-29 14:24:15	keb	yeah the -d was uneccessary at that point
2016-03-29 14:24:22	nschoe_	Well now that I know my system works, I don't need to rollback, but I had made a few modifications to my configuration.nix and was nto sure the system would be stable :-P
2016-03-29 14:25:01	keb	yeah things get unpleasant in nixos when you start running out of space
2016-03-29 14:25:06	nschoe_	keb, so... to sum it up: when I want to delete generations, I use nix-en -p [...]/system --delete-generations x y z and then nix-collect-garbage, as root, without "-d", right?

2016-03-29 14:25:21	keb	yes
2016-03-29 14:25:26	keb	or nix-store --gc
2016-03-29 14:25:47	keb	collect-garbage is a frontend that adds the -d feature and thats about it
2016-03-29 14:25:53	nschoe_	keb, what is done when I issue the first one "--delete-generations x y z" but do not run nix-cllect-garbage?
2016-03-29 14:26:00	keb	really it just combines the 2 commands
2016-03-29 14:26:12	keb	it just deletes those links
2016-03-29 14:26:17	keb	in /nix/var/nix/profiles
2016-03-29 14:26:22	keb	thats it
2016-03-29 14:26:32	keb	the GC is what actually cleans things that use space
2016-03-29 14:26:39	keb	out of /nix/store
2016-03-29 14:27:07	nschoe_	out of /nix/store okay, but... in /boot/EFI/nixos too I suppose? Otherwise... well my problem is not solved :/
2016-03-29 14:27:36	keb	it's a bug i guess
2016-03-29 14:27:45	keb	you found the issue on github
2016-03-29 14:27:50	keb	it'll get fixed eventually?

2016-03-29 17:16:40	copumpkin	haven't had any time recently for it :/
2016-03-29 17:16:48	copumpkin	was going okay at some point
2016-03-29 17:17:09	copumpkin	want to pick it up again but need longer days :(
2016-03-29 17:17:20	puffnfresh	how far did you get?
2016-03-29 17:17:22	copumpkin	I'm now tinkering with another silly idea that I can probably bite off more quickly
2016-03-29 17:17:37	copumpkin	I got the whole kernel building in our pure environment, but nothing beyond that
2016-03-29 17:17:41	copumpkin	still need to clean up that expression
2016-03-29 17:17:43	copumpkin	it's on my other computer
2016-03-29 17:17:55	copumpkin	I should put that up somewhere at least
2016-03-29 17:18:10	copumpkin	should be easier with the new llvm 3.8 release, too
2016-03-29 17:18:23	copumpkin	they fixed a few things that I needed to pull in a custom LLVM for to build the kernel
2016-03-29 17:18:45	copumpkin	right now I'm tinkering with the notion of a nondeterministic derivation
2016-03-29 17:18:50	copumpkin	which will be pretty cool if it works

2016-03-29 17:20:13	copumpkin	and my stuff is on my home computer
2016-03-29 17:21:14	puffnfresh	awesome, thanks, what's this nondeterministic thing?
2016-03-29 17:21:39	copumpkin	trying to come up with a principled way to get "latest" things and things that can be locked down
2016-03-29 17:21:53	copumpkin	think fetchGitRef, fetchIvy, fetchChannel, etc.

2016-03-29 17:23:28	copumpkin	so you can ask for the latest of things, but doing so will produce an anchor that you can use to get the thing you fetched
2016-03-29 17:23:41	puffnfresh	that would be useful!

2016-03-29 21:46:42	heirobloom	hi nixos...i'm relatively new to nix{,pkgs,os} and had a question about the pattern seen here: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/applications/networking/cluster/chronos/fetch-chronos-deps.sh
2016-03-29 21:47:32	gchristensen	heirobloom: ok
2016-03-29 21:48:12	heirobloom	i'm writing a derivation for a maven project with a relatively large dependency closure. and i'm wondering about the relative merits of just making the deps a single derivation, as seen in chronos and mesos, versus creating derivations for each remote file and composing them in a derivation for the m2 local repo
2016-03-29 21:48:32	pikajude	because uh
2016-03-29 21:48:46	pikajude	even if they don't, network-manager cannot satisfactorily connect to this router, where wpa_supplicant can
2016-03-29 21:49:17	heirobloom	the later way seems to get better composition/sharing/parallelism...but maybe it's an anti-pattern because you end up with many thousands of fixed-output terms?
2016-03-29 21:49:36	meloc	pikajude: oh? what type? WPA/WPA2/WEP? I've not had issues with NM (yet)
2016-03-29 21:49:51	pikajude	WPA/WPA2
2016-03-29 21:50:02	pikajude	it's a very standard router as far as i'm aware
2016-03-29 21:50:09	pikajude	but once i connect to it, I get "Destination unreachable" on ping
2016-03-29 21:50:12	pikajude	though google.com can load fine
2016-03-29 21:50:28	meloc	pikajude:that doesn't sound like NM not working then
2016-03-29 21:50:52	pikajude	it is unequivocally something network-manager is doing differently from wpa_supplicant
2016-03-29 21:50:55	meloc	pikajude: your router or upstream could be filtering icmp for example
2016-03-29 21:50:57	pikajude	and i don't know what that is
2016-03-29 21:51:07	pikajude	but this problem doesn't happen when using wpa_supplicant
2016-03-29 21:51:10	meloc	pikajude: I see. your pinging works with wpa_supplicant presumably. hm.

2016-03-30 02:09:47	viric_	do you have any idea why ld can complain like that? I link a program to libwx_baseu-2.8.so, and it says that it can't link it with libz unless I specify it. Yet the program doesn't use anything from libz
2016-03-30 02:10:31	domenkozar	the new binutils has some flags to prevent overlinking
2016-03-30 02:10:32	viric_	it's the result of "g++ -o myprog myprog.o `wx-config --libs`"
2016-03-30 02:10:40	domenkozar	probably one of you dependencies is missing zlib link

2016-03-30 05:08:20	gilligan_	phreedom, hm..what does builtins.filterSource return ? or rather what is the type of `src` actually ?  ./. is a filepath, but filterSource would return something different
2016-03-30 05:08:24	phreedom	gilligan_: so for example if you have some code_generator derivation which takes some xmls as src and outputs stuff into $out as usual, you can build it in another derivation with src = code_generator;

2016-03-30 05:10:11	phreedom	gilligan_: the type of src is in fact path. ./. is a derivation which when converted into a string, yields an absolute path
2016-03-30 05:10:47	phreedom	gilligan_: filtersource would create a directory in /nix/store, copy what you asked for there and yield the path as string
2016-03-30 05:10:58	gilligan_	phreedom, i am building a nodejs application and I have several derivations.. one that does `npm install` which only has package.json as src, another one is a derivation that bundles the client side code. For that i would preferably like to use some kind of whitelisting as to what files to use as input to the build (some files are server only and thus ./. is too big a scope concerning the relevant build input)

2016-03-30 05:42:42	JonReed	Hi, how can I deal with packages which have configuration in a read only location. E.g., cassandra installs its configuration inside /nix.
2016-03-30 05:42:43	viric	it'd be better if it could be made to fail or so, in that case
2016-03-30 05:42:54	viric	instead of workign with another vm
2016-03-30 05:43:16	viric	niksnut: a warning at the same line that reports the path kept, that'd be great
2016-03-30 05:43:33	JonReed	configuration inside `inside /nix/store/*/conf`*
2016-03-30 05:44:33	JonReed	more precisely in "/nix/store/6vx1npbyyhjf3wv5d7dxmc22asdvs94s-user-environment/conf" and there appears to be no paremeter to supply different configuration when starting cassandra

2016-03-30 08:27:13	aristid	or is that just as bad? hm
2016-03-30 08:27:22	domenkozar	that will help
2016-03-30 08:27:26	domenkozar	that's how we fixed chromium
2016-03-30 08:27:35	aristid	chromium uses gold?
2016-03-30 08:27:39	domenkozar	now it does
2016-03-30 08:27:47	aristid	sweet, should make building faster too
2016-03-30 08:27:52	domenkozar	because binutils 2.26 had a performance bug
2016-03-30 08:27:55	domenkozar	40min to link chrome

2016-03-30 08:29:21	domenkozar	so I'd prefer to fix outstanding ones and wait for 2.26.1
2016-03-30 08:29:26	domenkozar	which is probably going out soon

2016-03-30 11:40:15	phreedom	astsmtl: yeah I see, the problem is due to: %21, % causes the name to be split into joomla and 21, and 21 causes a match

2016-03-30 11:42:39	phreedom	astsmtl: actually as we talk, there's a dev instance doing another test run. unfortunately the monitor is a monster similar to hydra when it comes to testing that it really works :)
2016-03-30 11:43:31	phreedom	astsmtl: I will get it running very very soon, on my server. and then we'll need to prod ikwildrpepper to see how we can add another admin. and after that hopefully someone could made a small fix or two from time to time

2016-03-30 12:19:27	JonReed_	Hi, how can I force rebuilding a package. I'm installing a modified package (from git clone of nixpkgs)  using `nix-build -A cassandra; nix-env -f . -iA cassandra`. I'm trying to `nix-store --delete  /nix/store/qaf3nr038qz11pcay707j7bih7gkigbd-user-environment` (which is where cassandra is)
2016-03-30 12:19:36	JonReed_	but it says that it's still alive.
2016-03-30 12:20:19	obadz	JonReed_: any process still running that might use a binary from that directory?
2016-03-30 12:20:43	JonReed_	obadz: Ah. Most likely.
2016-03-30 12:21:26	nahamu	My goal is to build a custom version that runs from memory using only a kernel and initrd.
2016-03-30 12:22:24	p_l	btw, anyone has an idea on how to build NixOS for use in LXC container (standalone, without NixOS host?)
2016-03-30 12:22:57	nahamu	If I can get a minimal version built that includes systemd, zfs/spl, and the docker daemon I'll be headed in the right direction.

2016-03-30 13:45:16	simpson	Hi! I'm doing nixops on NixOS, and I want to deploy to vbox for testing.

2016-03-30 13:51:55	simpson	I'm on unstable, and I only added virtualisation.virtualbox.host.enable = true; to my NixOS config.
2016-03-30 13:52:03	simpson	nixops is from git.
2016-03-30 13:52:09	manveru	yeah, you need both
2016-03-30 13:52:30	simpson	Then I guess I'm not using vbox; this worked on Debian without having to grab the unfree pack.
2016-03-30 13:52:56	manveru	for unstable it should be http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.0.14/
2016-03-30 13:53:18	manveru	you can always use the container backend on nixos
2016-03-30 13:53:33	manveru	i really can't vouch for it being stable though
2016-03-30 13:53:41	simpson	Wait, what.

2016-03-31 03:15:46	FRidh	domenkozar: well, Python package sets and other sets were removed because evaluation of whole nixpgks was too slow right? And not because of limited disk space
2016-03-31 03:16:05	peti	FRidh: Is it really necessary to create that python-wip branch in the central repository? Can you not use a fork?
2016-03-31 03:16:06	domenkozar	FRidh: yes, but hydra now runs on ssd
2016-03-31 03:16:24	domenkozar	so evaluation times went from 6h to 7min
2016-03-31 03:16:37	domenkozar	also due to removal of central store

2016-03-31 03:17:14	FRidh	exactly, so it should be possible to build Python packages again then right

2016-03-31 03:40:35	viric	__Sander__: I mean.. in catalan we have the word "res" (nothing), but you can't say "tenim res" (we have nothing), you have to negate the verb for it to make sense, like what happens with "we do not have anything"

Then you can use the Makefile to build everything. Drawback: this works only if you're building Haskell programs. Libraries need more special magic t be re-used in Nix and your makefile won't do that.

2016-03-31 08:40:08	gchristensen	more directly, should the issue stay open, or be closed?

2016-03-31 08:55:47	__Sander__	the build slaves directly put them into a shared binary cache

2016-03-31 10:11:49	finnlandila	hey all o/ anybody uses hydra here?
2016-03-31 10:12:31	pikajude	i certainly do
2016-03-31 10:12:53	pikajude	although my hydra is officially broken
2016-03-31 10:13:18	finnlandila	is there a way to create postgres database and hydra user automatically from nixops or config somehow
2016-03-31 10:13:26	finnlandila	I do not like those manual steps
2016-03-31 10:13:33	pikajude	generally speaking it's pretty hard to create stateful data automatically in a nixops deploy
2016-03-31 10:13:35	finnlandila	where you need to create database
2016-03-31 10:13:38	finnlandila	and user manually
2016-03-31 10:13:39	pikajude	best you could do is write a systemd one-shot service
2016-03-31 10:13:50	pikajude	that creates some file once it's done that proves setup has already run
2016-03-31 10:15:02	finnlandila	I see some mappings option like from system user to postgres user https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/nixos/modules/services/databases/postgresql.nix#L93
2016-03-31 10:15:07	finnlandila	would that do something

2016-03-31 11:31:50	madbub	I just get a "Operating system not found" message when I power the laptop on
2016-03-31 11:32:13	madbub	my configuration.nix looks like this: http://pastebin.com/KGqVGArS
2016-03-31 11:32:26	madbub	I have a root partition on /dev/sda2
2016-03-31 11:32:43	madbub	a boot partition on /dev/sda1 (marked this one as bootable with fdisk)
2016-03-31 11:32:49	madbub	and a swap partition
2016-03-31 11:33:22	madbub	I did not modify anything filesystem-related because the config in hardware-configuration.nix seems just fine
2016-03-31 11:33:39	madbub	there's probably something really stupid I am missing here
2016-03-31 11:33:53	madbub	my computer is configured to boot in LEGACY mode (not UEFI)

2016-03-31 11:40:28	madbub	finnlandila: not sure how to answer that hahaha
2016-03-31 11:40:36	madbub	I just booted a flash drive with nixos
2016-03-31 11:40:50	madbub	created the partitions and formatted them

2016-03-31 13:39:17	erasmas	adnelson: hydra lets you specify top-level build inputs that aren't written down as nix expressions anywhere. you can specify a local path to files on the file system, a git checkout, etc. for various reasons it's better for this project if I use those than try to write nix expressions to run the git checkout
2016-03-31 13:39:46	erasmas	adnelson: I do appreciate the thought though
2016-03-31 13:40:04	adnelson	erasmas: ah I see, that makes sense. Yeah, sorry I can't really help then
2016-03-31 13:40:35	erasmas	does anyone here have much experience working with hydra build inputs? if the git settings can't be modified easily I'm wondering what the behavior is for file paths (specifically if some process is rsyncing to that local path, will hydra try to rebuild as soon as it detects a change? or is there a way to control that behavior?)

2016-03-31 15:23:10	benley	anyone know how to use Chrome/Chromium "managed policies" in nixos?
2016-03-31 15:23:27	benley	the chromium docs make it sound like you have to put stuff in /etc/opt/chrome of all weird places: https://www.chromium.org/administrators/linux-quick-start
2016-03-31 15:23:37	benley	what would be great is if I could keep it in my homedir somewhere
2016-03-31 15:23:47	benley	or if there's a sane place to set commandline flags for chrome startup, that would also work

2016-03-31 15:31:16	mucaho	greetings! i'm trying to create a package for vscode (MS's editor named Visual Studio Code). their installation script downloads the dependency electron, after patchelf'ing it work correctly. however, nixpkgs already has electron. should the derivation use this instead? the problem is vscode requires a **specific** version of electron

2016-03-31 17:17:01	anelson	hey guys, is there a way to edit the nixos config to use dhcp, without triggering a rebuild? I need to change my network configuration to use dhcp instead of a fixed IP, but if I do a `nixos-rebuild`, it will attempt to build a giant amount of packages
2016-03-31 17:17:27	anelson	maybe there's some way to brute-force modify whatever systemd unit is controlling this?
2016-03-31 17:17:39	sheenobu	can you use nixos-option?
2016-03-31 17:17:49	gchristensen	anelson: not really, because the systemd units are in a read-only store.
2016-03-31 17:19:46	joachifm	anelson: is it possible for you to switch to a channel that has binary substitutions available?
2016-03-31 17:19:57	anelson	well I have no network right now
2016-03-31 17:20:11	anelson	I brought my machine from work to home and I have no connectivity
2016-03-31 17:20:18	anelson	I assume (maybe incorrectly) that dhcp is why
2016-03-31 17:21:03	anelson	I want to switch to use dhcp so that I can connect, after that I can do a rebuild and I should be fine

2016-03-31 17:38:40	anelson	soooo the problem is I can't change anything in my nixos config because in order to get the new configuration to take, I need to build a ton of packages, and in order for that to happen, I need networking
2016-03-31 17:39:04	joachifm	anelson: I'm fairly sure that nixos will use dhcpcd in its default configuration
2016-03-31 17:39:27	joachifm	so if you didn't specifically set any of the networking options, you should already be using it
2016-03-31 17:41:18	anelson	I had set it as a fixed IP when I initially built it
2016-03-31 17:41:24	anelson	this was when I was at work

2016-03-31 17:43:19	joachifm	anelson: the dhcpcd.service just calls dhcpcd with a config file
2016-03-31 17:44:24	anelson	what config file
2016-03-31 17:44:27	anelson	maybe I can edit it
2016-03-31 17:45:01	--	rcyr is now known as systemfault
2016-03-31 17:45:26	anelson	calling `dhcpcd <my interface>` says "sending commmands to master dhcpcd process"
2016-03-31 17:45:37	joachifm	anelson: try killing dhcpcd first
2016-03-31 17:45:49	joachifm	anelson: that message indicates that dhcpcd is already running
2016-03-31 17:46:26	anelson	ok cool so I did systemctl stop dhcpcd
2016-03-31 17:46:47	anelson	and then reran dhcpcd enp3s0
2016-03-31 17:46:50	joachifm	anelson: okay, then you do have dhcpcd configured still
2016-03-31 17:46:52	anelson	ohhh it just timed out
2016-03-31 17:47:03	joachifm	as per the default
2016-03-31 17:47:06	anelson	on the "waiting for carrier" step
2016-03-31 17:47:35	anelson	joachifm: well I haven't given it anything as far as config flags or whatever
2016-03-31 17:47:48	anelson	and the nixos config is still the same b/c of the above issues
2016-03-31 17:48:28	joachifm	anelson: I get that, but you wouldn't have had dhcpcd.service if the config didn't already use dhcpcd, so changing the config probably won't do much
2016-03-31 17:48:44	joachifm	if all you wanted to do is change it to use dhcp
2016-03-31 17:49:37	anelson	hmm
2016-03-31 17:49:55	anelson	I guess I might have dhcp enabled somehow... or it's enabled by default and I didn't disable it
2016-03-31 17:49:56	anelson	but yeah
2016-03-31 17:50:09	joachifm	anelson: your best bet is to just kill everything that has to do with dhcpcd, bring down the interface, bring it up again, and run dhcpcd manually

2016-03-31 17:50:56	joachifm	anelson: see the dhcpcd.conf for any flags that may be of interest; perhaps I was lucky, but I never had to pass any special flags to get it to work

2016-03-31 17:54:00	joachifm	anelson: use systemctl cat dhcpcd.service to see exactly what the systemd unit is doing
2016-03-31 17:54:14	anelson	hmmmm well I finally got it to do something by using the -K option but I still can't connect to anything :(

2016-03-31 17:56:34	anelson	but no not really
2016-03-31 17:56:52	joachifm	how vexing ...
2016-03-31 17:57:19	anelson	ping is just giving me destination host unreachable even when I put in an IP
2016-03-31 17:57:59	anelson	if I had my nixos live cd I'd just boot into that and see if it worked
2016-03-31 17:59:19	joachifm	anelson: I can't really think of anything, sorry; at this point I'd already be online, so not sure what to do if dhcpcd cannot acquire a lease, apart from tearing down the iface and trying again ...
2016-03-31 18:00:11	anelson	yeah... sigh. Maybe something's weird with my router, although I've never had to do anything funky with it. thanks a bunch for the help so far
2016-03-31 18:00:51	joachifm	if you knew the gateway etc you could try setting it manually via ifconfig route
2016-03-31 18:01:18	anelson	I found a thumb drive, I guess I can just throw a nixos image on there and see what happens

2016-04-01 03:21:29	viric	peti: the header just says      blablablabla = deleted;
2016-04-01 03:21:39	Dezgeg	I don't think it means it in this context, there's a new thing in C++11
2016-04-01 03:21:43	viric	peti: a way to say "deprecated" I guess

2016-04-01 03:23:39	viric	yes, great :)

2016-04-01 03:23:46	vcunat	not in my gmail
2016-04-01 03:23:56	peti	domenkozar: Yeah, cryp.to has SPF records that don't include the Delft mailing list server, obviously.

2016-04-01 03:25:26	niksnut	I have to update the nixos.org certificate and I thought I might as well try out let's encrypt
2016-04-01 03:25:43	domenkozar	niksnut: the biggest automation issue we have is chicken-and-egg problem
2016-04-01 03:25:51	domenkozar	you can't start apache with ssl certs
2016-04-01 03:25:58	domenkozar	but you need to start it to verify domain
2016-04-01 03:26:03	domenkozar	via lets encrypt
2016-04-01 03:26:08	niksnut	hm yeah
2016-04-01 03:26:19	 *	peti wonders how to deal with mailing lists in the presence of SPF.
2016-04-01 03:26:24	niksnut	maybe it's possible to let apache ignore missing certs?
2016-04-01 03:26:24	hyper_ch	lets encrypt <3
2016-04-01 03:26:33	domenkozar	see https://github.com/snabblab/snabblab-nixos/blob/master/modules/hydra-master.nix#L135
2016-04-01 03:26:48	domenkozar	niksnut: my solution was to create snakeoil certs
2016-04-01 03:27:02	hyper_ch	domenkozar: for LE authentication ssl is not necessary IMHO
2016-04-01 03:27:09	peti	My messages have a proper DKIM signature, but they are delivered from a server that's technically not responsible for cryp.to, i.e. the mailing list server.
2016-04-01 03:27:16	viric	peti: so you did not send the message through the list? why not?
2016-04-01 03:27:24	domenkozar	niksnut: see https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/12655
2016-04-01 03:28:01	domenkozar	niksnut: not sure about apache, but not for nginx.
2016-04-01 03:28:18	niksnut	what's a snakeoil cert? a placeholder certificate?
2016-04-01 03:28:33	peti	viric: Oh, I did send the message through the list! The problem is that the server in Delft then relays it to all recipients, so these people receive a mail that says "from: simons@cryp.to", but it's not coming from a server that's associated with that domain.
2016-04-01 03:28:34	viric	never heard of it either
2016-04-01 03:28:53	viric	peti: but this is nothing new. It's how always has worked, isn't it?
2016-04-01 03:29:19	peti	viric: Absolutely. But according to Domen gmail now believes that my messages are spam. :-(
2016-04-01 03:29:23	hyper_ch	if you want I can send you an email "from"  president@whitehouse.gov
2016-04-01 03:29:48	domenkozar	niksnut: yes
2016-04-01 03:30:07	viric	peti: you have to rise your google-karma
2016-04-01 03:31:13	peti	viric: Maybe they are angry because I'm not uploading enough personal data? :-)
2016-04-01 03:31:41	viric	very likely.
2016-04-01 03:31:54	hyper_ch	google just wants to be best friend with you

2016-04-01 03:38:26	peti	viric: Anyway, back to the deleted function thing: If the code calls a deleted function, then it's misusing the API. Maybe the API of the regex class changed in a recent version of Boost and the package you're building hasn't been updated yet?
2016-04-01 03:38:33	domenkozar	done
2016-04-01 03:38:38	viric	peti: exactly
2016-04-01 03:38:51	viric	peti: it's unrelated to boost. Where did you see boost?

2016-04-01 03:39:33	hyper_ch	domenkozar: so what's the issue with apaches and ssl and letsencrypt
2016-04-01 03:40:03	domenkozar	https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/3/31/1108
2016-04-01 03:40:26	peti	domenkozar: Thank you! I think I know that the problem is. My DKIM signature is added by Postfix, but when I post to a mailing list via GMANE then my posting doesn't go through Postfix -- hence, no DKIM signature. Duh. :-(
2016-04-01 03:40:49	domenkozar	ah :)
2016-04-01 03:40:51	viric	what is gmane? the website?
2016-04-01 03:40:56	domenkozar	hyper_ch: did you read that issue?

2016-04-01 03:41:11	peti	viric: Ah, the error message said "std::regex", not "boost::regex". Sorry, I misread.
2016-04-01 03:41:29	viric	peti: I admit I also thought it was related to boost at first galce.
2016-04-01 03:41:34	viric	glance
2016-04-01 03:42:23	hyper_ch	domenkozar: now I see :)
2016-04-01 03:43:24	peti	viric: gmane.org is a free NNTP-to-mailing list gateway.
2016-04-01 03:44:04	peti	viric: It's nice because you can read pretty much any mailing list (and post!) without subscribing.

I need two systems to communicate on a single host, but there is no reason to ever propagate those credentials off the host.

2016-04-01 12:40:54	johbo	then use it as input for the next level

2016-04-01 12:43:09	ne0phyte	not that there is any difference lol, but just to be sure
2016-04-01 12:44:05	rschifflin	hmmm
2016-04-01 12:44:12	ne0phyte	I'm still new to nixos, but shouldn't you be able to use whatever packages you declare as dependencies in the build phases?
2016-04-01 12:45:19	rschifflin	so I can make a phase where I just `fetchfile` my manifest and have it live somewhere, and then use that as a dependency to my actual package derivation?

2016-04-01 12:47:08	ne0phyte	not sure I can follow haha. I was talking about letting your package *.nix depend on *foo* so after you fetchurl you can fetch the actual tarbar (or w/e) in the preUnpack phase
2016-04-01 12:47:23	radix	vcunat: The thing is, I have a build server that builds my binaries, and sometimes I try to build on my dev machine or deploy server before the binaries are available.
2016-04-01 12:47:52	radix	and then I realize the build server is about to finish and so I kill it and wait.
2016-04-01 12:48:16	ne0phyte	btw, is there any reason the wiki is donw?

2016-04-01 17:41:07	flyingmonkeys	Hello. I'm trying to add multiple entries to my /etc/hosts file. I am able to add a single entry with networking.extraHosts and I know that extraHosts is defined as a lines type. I am struggling with the syntax for taking advantage of the type. Any suggestions?
2016-04-01 17:42:07	dysinger	in what repo is the "Nixos manual" ? ( http://nixos.org/nix/manual/ ) I want to update the multi-user install for specific easy debian/ubuntu instructions.

2016-04-02 05:32:07	d-snp	it was about adding the option for "type=cifs" to systemd units
2016-04-02 05:33:44	d-snp	I can try it, but it's not super easy, basically there's two options: either remove the type check altogether, or make it dynamic somehow, as systemd allows any type for which a "mount.*" command exists in addition to the other ones
2016-04-02 05:34:00	d-snp	but I suspect that systemd probably allows for plugins that define additional types
2016-04-02 05:34:39	d-snp	so other packages should be able to define which service types are legal
2016-04-02 05:34:53	d-snp	in this case, setting type=cifs would be illegal until the cifs_utils package is installed

2016-04-02 07:00:58	ttuegel	bendlas: Oh, I guess I wanted to use DuplicateRecordFields, but I never implemented it. I take it you don't have cabal-install globally installed?
2016-04-02 07:01:30	bendlas	ttuegel: I had, but from a different ghc version. I had to uninstall it, to avoid build errors
2016-04-02 07:02:36	ttuegel	bendlas: Hm, that's odd. Well, I suppose I should just fix the *-packages.sh scripts so they don't need cabal-install in the first place.
2016-04-02 07:03:43	bendlas	might be that I'm retroactively confusing the error I saw. it might have been one of those build errors, I've been seeing with ghc8

2016-04-02 07:08:06	bendlas	ttuegel: like, threads are defaulted to be the number of CPUs (and can't be much higher without errors), does that limit the amount of concurrent IO (seems like it), or can haskell's IO engine handle multiple concurrent requests?

2016-04-02 10:24:40	eleanor	I'm currently developing a package that is missing from nixpkgs and the fetchFromGitHub is downloading it into nix store, so after entering the package's environment with nix-shell, I cannot build anything since it's a read-only store ... can I instruct the githubfetch to fetch into the current directory in order to experiment with it ?
2016-04-02 10:27:44	finnlandila	eleanor: my guess is that some mknode and things are enabled in order to make docker work and most probably some memory functions but somebody would have to dig trough source
2016-04-02 10:28:20	finnlandila	eleanor: I've read somewhere that some options need to be switched to make nix package manager work
2016-04-02 10:29:03	finnlandila	eleanor: at other q why u don't chmod it?
2016-04-02 10:29:10	simpson	eleanor: Are you trying to write a Nix expression for the package, or are you hacking on the package on a NixOS machine and you need a build environment?
2016-04-02 10:29:34	eleanor	simpson, I'm writing a new package definition .. I can post it online if you want
2016-04-02 10:29:35	simpson	finnlandila: chmod'ing stuff in the Nix store is a great way to break your environment but not a great way to solve Nix problems.
2016-04-02 10:31:17	simpson	eleanor: You're using fetchFromGitHub as the src in a derivation, right?
2016-04-02 10:31:49	simpson	In nix-shell, IIRC you can run $(unpackPhase) to set up the source tree for building.
2016-04-02 10:32:10	eleanor	simpson, yes
2016-04-02 10:32:17	rmrfroot	simpson: does the unpackPhase also set the $src env var?
2016-04-02 10:32:40	simpson	rmrfroot: Dunno. I have not used nix-shell for this particular purpose much.
2016-04-02 10:33:07	simpson	My typical strategy is to get the derivation more or less complete, and then iterate with nix-build until I get a satisfactory build.
2016-04-02 10:33:10	rmrfroot	simpson: alright, I'll have to check myself as soon as the 16.03 upgrade is complete :)
2016-04-02 10:33:47	eleanor	simpson, basically the unpackPhase returns "do not know how to unpack source archive /nix/store/wpvjxbqsxlx7ndnpkaczxa1llzlnj4c1-mail-notification-9ae8768-src"; but the contents of the mail-notification program are in the nix store already
2016-04-02 10:35:18	simpson	Hmmm. That's a stumper.
2016-04-02 10:35:35	simpson	Could I please see what you've got so far? One of the best parts of Nix is that I shouldn't have any trouble reproducing.

2016-04-02 10:42:35	eleanor	is it possible the unpack happened in one of the previous invocations? I'm wondering why the package is downloaded into the /nix/store/wpvjxbqsxlx7ndnpkaczxa1llzlnj4c1-mail-notification-9ae8768-src, since when running the phases manually, like unpackPhase, buildPhase, etc, will not be able to change the contents in there because of the read-only store... basically I'm thinking of copying the sources from nix store and building in another

2016-04-02 10:43:45	simpson	eleanor: When you fetchFromGitHub, the git repo's contents are put in the Nix store, because you promised that they would have a predictable hash.
2016-04-02 10:44:04	simpson	eleanor: If you would need to build again, Nix will not have to refetch the repo. That is why it's in the store.
2016-04-02 10:44:21	simpson	So yes, some copying will have to be done, but it should be done automatically by the builder.

2016-04-02 10:44:41	simpson	So, just slapping it into nixpkgs and attempting a build, I got "ERROR: the GLib library was not found"
2016-04-02 10:44:49	simpson	Which is probably an easier thing to fix.
2016-04-02 10:45:53	rmrfroot	obadz: however using ' infront of the dir name works for me: "cd 'a b[tab]"

2016-04-02 10:46:20	simpson	And then $(./jb configure) returns the same "ERROR: the GLib library was not found" as before.

2016-04-02 13:26:28	mucaho	greetings! how do I append/prepend the rpath with the patchELF command? AFAIK, you can replace the whole path with `--set-rpath`. `--print-rpath` returns some $ORIGIN env var which is empty, huh? I oppened issue for that, https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf/issues/87
2016-04-02 13:30:26	mucaho	aha, I guess if I feed the $ORIGIN var back to the patchELF command, it can expand it from its environment variables. So something like `patchELF --set-rpath echo ${patchELF --print-rpath}:/path/to/appended/entry` should work

2016-04-02 13:35:25	kostja	what is the prefered way to install new packages? adding them to configuration.nix or using nix-env?

2016-04-02 13:40:03	mucaho	kostja: `nix-env -q` lists all installed packages
2016-04-02 13:40:22	mucaho	kostja: `nix-env -qa firefox` to search for package named firefox
2016-04-02 13:40:40	mucaho	kostja: `nix-env -i firefox` to install package named firefox
2016-04-02 13:40:48	kostja	yes I know nix-env -q
2016-04-02 13:41:25	mucaho	another alternative is to add those packages to `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`
2016-04-02 13:41:33	kostja	but how would I build all packages at once on a new machine? certainly I don't want to enter them one by one
2016-04-02 13:41:33	ktosiek	protip: use nix-env -qaP for searching, and then nix-env -iA path for installing
2016-04-02 13:41:51	ktosiek	much faster and more reliable (but still will use names when updating)
2016-04-02 13:42:12	mucaho	use the latter alternative, they are installed/updated on system rebuild `nixos-rebuild switch`
2016-04-02 13:43:20	ktosiek	I'm not sure if the "reinstall on another PC" is really supported with nix-env, but it should be easy with configuration.nix
2016-04-02 13:43:27	kostja	can nix-env add those packages to configuration.nix, like portage adds installed packages to world file?
2016-04-02 13:43:30	mucaho	ktosiek: good tip, I wonder why its not `nix-
2016-04-02 13:43:49	ktosiek	kostja: nope
2016-04-02 13:43:51	mucaho	.. `nix-env -qA` to search for packages

2016-04-02 13:44:15	ktosiek	nix-env and configuration.nix are separate approaches to managing packages
2016-04-02 13:44:47	mucaho	yes, but I guess he wants a helper script, which adds one/all packages to system configuration from user environment
2016-04-02 13:44:57	kostja	because nix-env is independent of nixos
2016-04-02 13:45:51	kostja	also, is there a way to add stdenv to the users enviornemt? it's strange not to have make et al available and installing them by hand

2016-04-02 18:44:19	flyinprogrammer	thanks for the help!
2016-04-02 18:44:47	slacktest	Mmm I was to look on the wiki but maybe I'll try here. On the archwiki its recommended to mess with udev rules (on a systemd system) to get sane running under regular users
2016-04-02 18:45:16	juju_	yeah, I am just wondering is it temporary or not. I remember during fall nixconf somone was saying that wiki needs to be taken down
2016-04-02 18:45:16	phreedom	finnlandila: have you had any luck with nixops?
2016-04-02 18:45:25	slacktest	does this translate to nixos? should I get doing a custom udev override?
2016-04-02 18:45:53	gchristensen	juju_: I'm not aware of it being intentionally taken down
2016-04-02 18:46:01	simpson	phreedom: BTW I got all my GCE problems figured out. I didn't have a good mental model for what was going on, but I eventually got it.
2016-04-02 18:46:08	flyinprogrammer	@slacktest probably - what overrides were you looking to do ?
2016-04-02 18:46:13	gchristensen	but (I say, completely unofficially...) it could be the impetus to not bring it back up
2016-04-02 18:46:16	juju_	gchristensen_: thanks!
2016-04-02 18:46:59	slacktest	SANE ones. I don't like running imagescan as root :-P
2016-04-02 18:47:07	gchristensen	garbas: what if a "first step" on the "move the wiki" milestone was copying the contents to the issue tracker, so when the wiki is down, it ins't really gone?

2016-04-02 18:58:37	newhoggy	I have a question regarding switching profiles.  The docs says "If the profile doesn’t exist, it will be created automatically", but when I enter "nix-env --switch-profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/haskell" the symlink isn't created and I lose `nix-env` from my path.

2016-04-02 21:55:43	brandonz	heh. this wiki outage is rough. trying to figure out how to trip a kernel recompile now that I've attempted to set kernelPatches and the wayback machine failed to index some of the wiki hardware pages that likely have discussion of patching the kernel.

2016-04-02 22:09:55	joachifm	brandonz: what do you mean "trip a kernel recompile"?
2016-04-02 22:10:47	brandonz	joachifm: I followed the instructions in How to tweak Linux kernel config options added. nixpkgs.config ... kernelPatches. but now am unsure how to get the kernel to rebuild with those patches. nixos-rebuild switch; apparently is not enough.
2016-04-02 22:14:58	joachifm	brandonz: then it's not being passed to the package that ends up being used by the config
2016-04-02 22:15:30	brandonz	so then I have a typo in my specification; so I'm not really affecting the kernel. let me look over again what I specified versus what was written in the wiki.
2016-04-02 22:15:32	joachifm	brandonz: additional patches certainly consitute a change in inputs and so should in itself be sufficient to trigger a rebuild
2016-04-02 22:16:02	joachifm	brandonz: what is the link? just so I know what you're looking at
2016-04-02 22:16:35	joachifm	(in my experience, the wiki wasn't always up-to-date or even accurate)
2016-04-02 22:18:11	joachifm	so it being down isn't really all that bad, imo ...

2016-04-02 22:24:42	brandonz	I'm actually poking through pkgs/os-specific/linux/kernel now; trying to figure out how to get something correct.
2016-04-02 22:24:57	joachifm	brandonz: yeah, that's what you want
2016-04-02 22:25:17	joachifm	brandonz: I recommend starting at the linuxPackages assignments in all-packages.nix
2016-04-02 22:27:24	joachifm	you'd do an override on the base kernel expression and then do something morally equivalent to boot.linuxPackages = linuxPackagesFor myPatchedKernel in your configuration.nix.
2016-04-02 22:28:42	brandonz	interesting, i'll keep researching / experimenting.

2016-04-02 22:31:33	joachifm	that'd make more sense if you didn't set linuxPackages directly but instead had to rely on pkgs.kernelPackage; then you'd have to override it in the package set to make use of your customization

2016-04-03 04:20:37	iri	This feels like a silly question, but I can't figure it out from the docs and I've been experimenting for a bit. Is there a way to install nix that requires no network activity? Let's say I download one binary + nixpkgs, and then from there I can get a nix installation and install packages without the build cache?

2016-04-03 04:24:50	MichaelRaskin	Well, you can actually download all the packages you need and make a passive binary cache
2016-04-03 04:25:49	MichaelRaskin	Do I understand correctly that you are OK doing an arbitrary number of reasonable operations on an internet-connected machine but want to end up with a single archive to copy to the no-network target?

2016-04-03 04:41:45	MichaelRaskin	You can try using release.nix instead, just to get a lot of packages, but this may turn out to be annoying

2016-04-03 04:43:34	MichaelRaskin	nix-store or nix-push?
2016-04-03 04:43:37	iri	So the thing I want to end up with is not an installation with a particular set of packages, but an installation of nix from which I can subsequently build other packages.
2016-04-03 04:43:51	MichaelRaskin	I think nix-push will contain NixPkgs (package metadata)
2016-04-03 04:44:02	iri	For example, if I'm willing to cache the sources of all of the dependencies of something I want to build later.
2016-04-03 04:44:26	MichaelRaskin	The problem is: you want to build offline, that means you want to have a lot of sources
2016-04-03 04:44:40	iri	I'm OK with that.
2016-04-03 04:45:02	iri	Or equally with keeping a binary cache of nix builds (derivations?) around.
2016-04-03 04:45:22	MichaelRaskin	nix-serve allows you to use a store as a cache

2016-04-03 04:53:42	MichaelRaskin	I have a NixPkgs-based minimal (init=busybox) system on my notebook, and deploying onto an empty system means «I have a bot flash with Nix and an empty har drive»
2016-04-03 04:54:09	MichaelRaskin	Looks like just user infrastructure and resolv.conf/services/protocols are needed in the network-available scenario

2016-04-03 04:56:00	iri	so I should be able to do the standard nix network-based install, then tar up the /nix directory. Then all I should need to do is make a nixbld user/group and untar it?

2016-04-03 07:14:18	tormen	Hi. Is it possible within the configuration.nix to tell grub to use a LUKS encrypted /boot partition ?
2016-04-03 07:15:30	globin	tormen: yes, just a sec
2016-04-03 07:15:41	gchristensen	globin: did you see my message about the wiki?
2016-04-03 07:15:48	tormen	Or to help me to help myself : I am new to nixos and there is one thing I couldn't yet see : How can one easily see all the possible options for grub for instance within configuration.nix ? Is there a man page that lists them all or many ? or how does one do ?
2016-04-03 07:15:55	tormen	:)
2016-04-03 07:15:59	tormen	globin: cool !!
2016-04-03 07:16:32	globin	tormen boot.loader.grub.enableCryptodisk = true;
2016-04-03 07:16:49	globin	but with just that you have to unlock your HDD twice

2016-04-03 07:17:11	tormen	globin: yes, read about this in the archwiki and they proposed a 2nd key...
2016-04-03 07:17:25	tormen	globin: great! I'll try my luck :))
2016-04-03 07:17:36	globin	tormen: I know :)

2016-04-03 07:18:51	tormen	globin: any chance you could explain me: How can one easily see all the possible options for grub for instance within configuration.nix ? Is  there a man page that lists them all or many ? or how does one do ?
2016-04-03 07:19:18	globin	easiest: https://nixos.org/nixos/options.html

2016-04-03 07:57:12	ptek	I am interested in deploying a haskell project to several VMs in our own infrastructure. They can be running NixOS. Would you use nixops for that?
2016-04-03 07:59:23	ptek	so far, I have found only documentation on nixops for deploying to EC2, Hetzner or Google Cloud Engine
2016-04-03 07:59:33	ptek	thats the tutorial

2016-04-03 08:21:01	ptek	and what we have been doing so far, is just deploying via SSH to the machines running debian. Now that we have found the machines being surprisingly different from the way we have configured them in the very beginning, we think of using something better. So I thought of looking into NixOS and NixOPS because I really like the idea of immutable infrastructure

2016-04-03 09:58:14	nschoe	No idea, anyone?
2016-04-03 09:58:47	simpson	nschoe: Python generally wants an environment.
2016-04-03 09:59:07	simpson	nschoe: The niftiest thing to do, I've found, is to make a nix-shell environment. There's a recipe in the docs; one sec.
2016-04-03 09:59:56	simpson	nschoe: http://nixos.org/nix/manual/#sec-nix-shell Scroll down to the Python prettytable example.
2016-04-03 10:00:09	nschoe	simpson, thanks, I'll look into it!

2016-04-03 10:00:52	simpson	You can invoke that directly, with something like $(nix-shell -p pythonPackages.prettytable) to get a live bash shell, and everything in there will have the right Python modules.

2016-04-03 10:05:10	nschoe	simpson, yeah I see that, but what if I want to run my app.py? TThe shortcut can't be applied because it's not in pythonPAckages
2016-04-03 10:05:53	simpson	nschoe: Does your app.py import locally? It should be fine.
2016-04-03 10:06:22	nschoe	simpson, (to be honest I'm very new to Python, I usually use OpenCV with C :/), what does "import locally" mean?
2016-04-03 10:06:26	nschoe	It starts with 'import cv2'
2016-04-03 10:06:56	simpson	nschoe: Let's make sure that that works, then. First, just a quick sanity check: Try $ nix-shell -p pythonPackages.requests
2016-04-03 10:07:39	nschoe	simpson, seems to work, yes :-)
2016-04-03 10:07:44	simpson	And then, inside that new shell, run $ python -c 'import requests; print requests.__version__'
2016-04-03 10:08:11	nschoe	simpson, yup, got "1.2.3"
2016-04-03 10:08:33	simpson	nschoe: Okay, great. So, I don't see opencv offhand; what's the names of the packages that we're using?
2016-04-03 10:08:55	simpson	Is it pythonPackages.cvxopt?

2016-04-03 10:10:15	nschoe	Isn't the fact that I installed nixos.opencv enough?
2016-04-03 10:10:29	MichaelRaskin	opencv is the C/C++ library

2016-04-03 10:11:14	simpson	Maybe there's a Python support flag?
2016-04-03 10:11:22	nschoe	MichaelRaskin, ah! Good to know, thanks. And does the Python opencv library depends on the C/C++ lib, or are they independant?
2016-04-03 10:11:39	MichaelRaskin	I think it should be a wrapper
2016-04-03 10:11:43	simpson	Ah, bless the binary cache.
2016-04-03 10:12:18	simpson	Okay, so it looks like there's an enableBloat flag.
2016-04-03 10:12:31	simpson	https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/libraries/opencv/default.nix
2016-04-03 10:12:31	MichaelRaskin	opencv3 seems to include python bindings
2016-04-03 10:12:52	MichaelRaskin	Or maybe not
2016-04-03 10:13:54	ktosiek	umm, anyone has problems with firefox on current unstable?
2016-04-03 10:14:42	nschoe	simpson, so, 'enableBloat' flag makes the deps inside the [...] be installed as well, correct?
2016-04-03 10:14:50	nschoe	And how to enable the flag then?
2016-04-03 10:15:00	ktosiek	I'm getting a "seccomp sandbox violation"

2016-04-03 10:16:44	nschoe	simpson, okay. And regarding yoru previous questions about the name of the packages in pythonPackages.xxx, I always struggle (same problem with haskellPackages): how to use nix-env to search through these haskellPackages/ pythonPackages?
2016-04-03 10:16:51	nschoe	They don't appear on a "normal" nix-env search
2016-04-03 10:17:27	simpson	Currently trying $ nix-shell -p 'opencv.override { enableBloat = true; }'
2016-04-03 10:17:44	simpson	I usually use nix-repl. Something like $ nix-repl '<nixpkgs>'
2016-04-03 10:17:56	simpson	And then tab-surf through pkgs or pythonPackages or etc.

2016-04-03 13:10:49	phreedom	Forkk: and it works
2016-04-03 13:11:00	Forkk	yeah so something else must be wrong
2016-04-03 13:11:00	phreedom	Forkk: so apparently the patch is hardcoded in master
2016-04-03 13:11:09	Forkk	maybe it's set in the git config somewhere
2016-04-03 13:11:11	Forkk	patch?
2016-04-03 13:11:12	phreedom	but you had an env var set to /no-cert or something
2016-04-03 13:11:36	Forkk	I only have that set when I'm in one of my development environments
2016-04-03 13:11:50	Forkk	which is a separate issue that I also need to resolve :|
2016-04-03 13:12:00	phreedom	Forkk: take a careful looko at set output to see if there are some vars which sound like they refer to certs, ssl or git
2016-04-03 13:13:24	Forkk	don't see any
2016-04-03 13:13:42	phreedom	Forkk: maybe you are running git built from an old checkout on a new system or something like this?
2016-04-03 13:14:03	Forkk	maybe
2016-04-03 13:14:04	pikajude	is there a documented way to make a nix channel out of a local path?
2016-04-03 13:14:11	Forkk	there's no git listed in nix-env -q though
2016-04-03 13:14:51	Forkk	`which git` lists /nix/var/nix/profiles/default/bin/git
2016-04-03 13:16:14	phreedom	aha
2016-04-03 13:16:30	phreedom	Forkk: and the system one would be at profiles/system
2016-04-03 13:16:41	phreedom	Forkk: so it could be an older build
2016-04-03 13:17:10	phreedom	Forkk: what I find surprising is that strace doesn't show git poking around and looking for certificates at all :/

2016-04-03 13:19:02	Forkk	so phreedom, does this mean I'm probably running a lot of old software or something?
2016-04-03 13:20:05	Forkk	and yeah, installing git via nix-env fixes the problem
2016-04-03 13:20:11	phreedom	Forkk:  I have an older nixos version which has env vars set and git works, and I have a master build which works without env vars. what you are running isn't necessarily old but may be incompatible

2016-04-03 13:26:28	Forkk	channels are nice and easy to manage
2016-04-03 13:27:08	MichaelRaskin	Rust unstable on unstable should be the end of March
2016-04-03 13:27:20	codehero	for some reason nix unstable builds the linux kernel when installing on virtualbox

2016-04-03 13:34:55	Forkk	how fast do security patches generally get through on stable?
2016-04-03 13:34:59	codehero	to be honest, I don't see why I'd need stable
2016-04-03 13:35:06	codehero	i can just roll back if something breaks
2016-04-03 13:35:11	Forkk	yeah same
2016-04-03 13:35:22	codehero	Forkk: security patches on both stable and unstable are....unsatisfactory
2016-04-03 13:35:28	Forkk	and really I haven't had to roll back in a long time
2016-04-03 13:35:29	codehero	but pierron is working on that
2016-04-03 13:35:33	Forkk	that's good
2016-04-03 13:35:48	Forkk	the state of security patches on unstable has been bleh for a while
2016-04-03 13:36:08	Forkk	I didn't know it was bad on stable too though
2016-04-03 13:36:08	codehero	yeah
2016-04-03 13:36:20	codehero	i'm pretty sure it was bad on stable as well
2016-04-03 13:36:24	codehero	well still is
2016-04-03 13:36:43	codehero	that's the reason why i switched back to arch for now
2016-04-03 13:36:52	Forkk	theoretically stable would be better, since it would only be receiving the security fixes, rather than large updates as well
2016-04-03 13:37:14	codehero	yeah, but mass rebuilds are mass rebuilds
2016-04-03 13:37:19	codehero	and those cause the biggest trouble
2016-04-03 13:37:19	Forkk	iirc, the problem is that other packages breaking the builds delay security patches
2016-04-03 13:37:26	Forkk	oh it's just the mass rebuilds
2016-04-03 13:37:38	codehero	well, other packages breaking builds is also a problem, yes
2016-04-03 13:37:42	codehero	it's both
2016-04-03 13:37:52	Forkk	yeah honestly that's been the one of the most frustrating things for me about nixos
2016-04-03 13:38:11	Forkk	the release schedule needs some work
2016-04-03 13:38:17	Forkk	it's a hard problem to solve though
2016-04-03 13:38:47	Forkk	I guess for now I'll stick with unstable, though

2016-04-03 13:41:51	micxjo	Is there a page anywhere with an overview of how hydra, channels, build caches,  etc. all fit together? Just started using nixos and am trying to wrap my mind around the package lifecycle
2016-04-03 13:44:36	Forkk	that looks incredibly tedious lol
2016-04-03 13:44:55	codehero	heh, yeah

2016-04-03 13:45:20	codehero	you have to go through all-packages and paste "self." in front of all self references and check if the hash changes
2016-04-03 13:45:31	codehero	but it's pretty simple, so anyone could do it
2016-04-03 13:45:52	Forkk	sounds like it could be automated somehow
2016-04-03 13:46:00	codehero	i'm actually just installing nixos on virtualbox for that exact purpose
2016-04-03 13:46:09	codehero	hm. you could perhaps automate it
2016-04-03 13:46:27	joachifm	micxjo: the package is built by the build farm (hydra), then copied to the cache; a channel is just a pointer to a collection of nix expressions and a pointer to a binary cache; typically, channels are updated (usually, the nixexprs pointer is moved ahead) when certain channel critical tests pass. that's about it.
2016-04-03 13:46:31	Forkk	wouldn't be very easy, but it's probably doable
2016-04-03 13:46:51	codehero	yeah. if someone could do that, that would be great
2016-04-03 13:47:08	Forkk	not sure what all it would involve
2016-04-03 13:47:12	phreedom	Forkk: ok the reason nixos is missing the ssl env vars is because they wer wiped by accident and then quickly restored and we both happen to run the broken version :D
2016-04-03 13:47:35	Forkk	phreedom: the broken version being the current latest unstable
2016-04-03 13:47:49	Forkk	so we're probably not alone
2016-04-03 13:48:18	phreedom	Forkk: what's still suspicioius is that I can't break git by setting SSL_CERT_FILE to something nonexistent which means it isn't used
2016-04-03 13:48:26	phreedom	Forkk: it's fixed in master at least
2016-04-03 13:48:51	Forkk	but there are probably as many people using that
2016-04-03 13:48:56	phreedom	while I can break git by setting the git-specific env var to something that doesn't exist

2016-04-03 13:50:46	Forkk	:(
2016-04-03 13:51:38	Forkk	is there some standalone library for parsing nix files to an AST?
2016-04-03 13:51:39	phreedom	Forkk: but it's supposed to use both
2016-04-03 13:52:23	Forkk	clearly it's broken, but I doubt it's not checking, as it does break when you change the git-specific var
2016-04-03 13:53:50	micxjo	joachifm: Thanks. So are the channel pointers updated manually, or does hydra/whatever do that automatically when the proper tests pass?
2016-04-03 13:55:31	joachifm	micxjo: it will move the pointer to the nixexprs archive used in the build
2016-04-03 13:55:51	gchristensen	joachifm: is that when the tested job passes? or when?

2016-04-03 13:58:16	phreedom	Forkk: aha. so the cert file path is now hardcoded deep in the system and SSL_CERT_FILE is indeed not used by git
2016-04-03 13:58:26	joachifm	gchristensen: my understanding is that it happens when all builds are complete & channel critical builds succed
2016-04-03 13:58:38	Forkk	phreedom: that makes sense I guess

2016-04-03 13:58:53	gchristensen	joachifm: yeah, I guess I'm trying to get a solid understanding of when that happens and specifically what does it.

2016-04-04 02:24:41	puffnfresh	the real problem is making intermediate tars for no reason
2016-04-04 02:25:01	puffnfresh	well, the reason is for consistency with the tarball file feature

2016-04-04 04:44:40	gilligan_	Lethalman, my google-fu fails me - which are those ?
2016-04-04 04:44:53	Lethalman	manveru, well, you can call nixos to build the system, and use that as contents for the docker image
2016-04-04 04:45:02	Lethalman	manveru, you should then be able to call /init :)
2016-04-04 04:45:15	Lethalman	of course there may be many things that can go wrong there ;)
2016-04-04 04:45:21	Lethalman	gilligan_, getEnv
2016-04-04 04:45:24	manveru	of course :P

2016-04-04 04:46:25	gilligan_	Lethalman, thanks
2016-04-04 04:47:53	gilligan_	talking about dockerTools .. Lethalman, for debugging/testing purposes, is there some easy way to inspect the directory contents contained in the tar.gz I create with dockerTools.buildImage ?
2016-04-04 04:48:18	gilligan_	Lethalman, the standard docker tooling does not seem to be very helpful in that regard
2016-04-04 04:48:34	manveru	you can include coreutils and then `docker run <yourimage> ls /nix/store` or the like
2016-04-04 04:49:35	Lethalman	gilligan_, just unpack them
2016-04-04 04:49:54	Lethalman	gilligan_, or yeah, run docker and explore the filesystem, whatever
2016-04-04 04:50:33	gilligan_	Lethalman, the problem was that for some reason i couldn't run anything which led me to assume i somehow messed something up - so i would rather have to just unpack it
2016-04-04 04:51:13	Lethalman	well yes unpacking is quite a raw operation, but you can import the docker and run an ls as manveru says
2016-04-04 04:51:46	katyucha	euh... wiki will come back ?
2016-04-04 04:52:34	manveru	Lethalman: i think the biggest difficulty trying to run nixos inside docker is systemd...
2016-04-04 04:52:46	manveru	it probably needs at least some root permissions for that
2016-04-04 04:53:10	manveru	so i'd rather use runit or s6 for that part

2016-04-04 05:34:58	peti	IMHO, Nix support in Stack is rather poor. It should pick up *all* dependencies from Nix, not just system libraries.
2016-04-04 05:35:33	taeradan	I've searched "wiki" in the IRC backlog, and I've only seen questions about the wiki, but without any answer, is there an admin here ?
2016-04-04 05:36:16	peti	It would be great if someone would implement stack2nix (https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/issues/212) so that can convert Stack files into a nix-shell environment that contains everything needed to run the Stack build.
2016-04-04 05:36:28	peti	That code could then relocate into stack directly, IMHO.
2016-04-04 05:36:45	taeradan	a few days without the wiki is really bloking, especially when migrating from another OS

2016-04-04 06:16:42	peti	Profpatsch: I don't know, really. I thought the --nix argument simply added ghc plus other system dependencies into the respective search paths. But I've never tried it, really.

2016-04-04 07:46:27	NicolasPetton	__Sander__: I'd like to add a package (eslint), do you know how I could do it?
2016-04-04 07:46:32	clever	rardiol: but nix-env works without root, and lets each user have their own set of private apps
2016-04-04 07:46:50	NicolasPetton	__Sander__: the packages are broken upstream, or is it a npm2nix/nix issue?
2016-04-04 07:46:58	__Sander__	both
2016-04-04 07:47:05	NicolasPetton	how so?
2016-04-04 07:47:13	__Sander__	some packages no longer exist
2016-04-04 07:47:16	__Sander__	upstream

2016-04-04 07:47:28	__Sander__	second
2016-04-04 07:47:34	obadz	Is it appropriate to cherry-pick 3a75ed4 on 16.03? (maybe domenkozar?)
2016-04-04 07:47:37	__Sander__	there are some things npm2nix does not implement properly

2016-04-04 07:48:07	__Sander__	there is already a "solution" sort of
2016-04-04 07:48:17	__Sander__	but the solution isn't generally accepted yet

2016-04-04 16:01:55	alesguzik	Hi. I'm trying to get started with nixops. I'm following instructions in nixops manual, and step 3 in installation section says to find latest stable release at http😕 /hydra.nixos.org/project/nixops#tabs-releases and use nix-install-package with url for that release. It looks like latest stable release is http😕 /hydra.nixos.org/release/nixops/nixops-1.3. Problem is that any package link on that page (e.g. http😕 /hydra.nixos.org/build/264
2016-04-04 16:01:55	alesguzik	57165/nix/pkg/nixops-1.3-x86_64-linux.nixpkg) leads to 404, stating things like "Path /nix/store/5h1654v8jjfwjry40lbym18p8vdw58ax-nixops-1.3 is no longer available."
2016-04-04 16:03:01	alesguzik	How can I install nixops package then?

2016-04-04 19:09:45	jfntn	I'm trying to setup my first dev environment on NixOS for an api server that uses multiple databases

2016-04-04 19:16:34	jfntn	I *think* my options right now are 1) add the db deps to buildInputs and use shellHooks to do the setup, 2) create a container imperatively and sync its configuration.nix with my host, 3) same as 2 but use nixops to start VMs instead
2016-04-04 19:17:22	jfntn	Setup takes a really long time, so my main concern is to be able to persist the db state across sessions

2016-04-05 03:14:02	MoreTea	Does the term "nix expression" originate in the fact that it's like an arithmetic expression? So then it would be referring to purity, right?
2016-04-05 03:14:20	MoreTea	(context: I'm writing a blog post about nix-the-language)
2016-04-05 03:15:37	Shell	MoreTea: I think it comes from the more general use of expression in programming - a construct that evaluates to a value that can be used in further expressions or statements.

2016-04-05 03:32:25	Shell	well, it's a construct that computes to a value. you use it as a value.
2016-04-05 03:34:21	MoreTea	And how does that differ from computing an arithmetic expression? It also is a construct that computes to a value, and can be used as a value.
2016-04-05 03:39:26	Shell	well, sure, but you tend to confuse people less when you refer to existing well-defined computing concepts rather than reaching for analogies in other fields. you're not finding the solution to a math problem here, unless you happen to be a computer scientist and researching something specific about the properties of a Nix expression.

2016-04-05 11:34:06	clever	nkaretnikov`: you could use lib.readFile instead?, to embed the keys into the files nixos generates?
2016-04-05 11:34:40	nkaretnikov`	clever: but that would mean messing with the store, which is a bad idea. no?
2016-04-05 11:34:45	clever	nkaretnikov`: also, can you pastebin your config?, there might be some other minor mistakes with it
2016-04-05 11:36:25	nkaretnikov`	clever: no, i can't unfortunately
2016-04-05 11:36:34	nkaretnikov`	clever: what kind of mistakes do you have in mind?
2016-04-05 11:36:44	clever	are you setting keyFiles to a string or a path?
2016-04-05 11:37:22	clever	if you set it to a path, then nix will hash and import that into the store, and any changes to the contents will trigger an sshd service restart (at the next nixos-rebuild switch)
2016-04-05 11:37:32	nkaretnikov`	clever: i use both keys and keyFiles
2016-04-05 11:37:35	clever	but if you set it to a string, nix wont import it, and will never notice when the file has changed
2016-04-05 11:37:43	nkaretnikov`	keys are hardcoded strings, keyFiles are filenames
2016-04-05 11:37:54	clever	are those filenames quoted or unquoted?
2016-04-05 11:38:32	nkaretnikov`	clever: what do you mean by that? in fact, i have only one file in there. something like /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys
2016-04-05 11:39:06	nkaretnikov`	clever: the idea is to make ssh-copy-id work
2016-04-05 11:39:10	nkaretnikov`	which uses the said file
2016-04-05 11:39:36	clever	that wont make ssh-copy-id work any better
2016-04-05 11:39:42	nkaretnikov`	clever: huh?
2016-04-05 11:39:46	nkaretnikov`	clever: i'm not following
2016-04-05 11:39:52	clever	ssh should already read ~/.ssh/authorized_keys by default

2016-04-05 11:41:02	clever	just use .authorizedKeys only
2016-04-05 11:41:25	clever	AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys2 /etc/ssh/authorized_keys.d/%u
2016-04-05 11:41:26	nkaretnikov`	you mean keyFiles?
2016-04-05 11:41:29	clever	nope
2016-04-05 11:41:36	clever	this is from the default sshd_config that nixos generates
2016-04-05 11:41:48	clever	it tells sshd to search those 3 locations for keys when a user tries to sign in
2016-04-05 11:41:58	nkaretnikov`	clever: that's a no go for me
2016-04-05 11:42:13	nkaretnikov`	i don't want to rely on implicit behavior
2016-04-05 11:42:36	clever	https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/nixos/modules/services/networking/ssh/sshd.nix#L304
2016-04-05 11:42:38	nkaretnikov`	instead, i want to specify everything in the configuration.nix file
2016-04-05 11:42:46	nkaretnikov`	well, see above
2016-04-05 11:42:47	clever	its setup in this part of the sshd module
2016-04-05 11:43:02	hyper_ch	where's vcunat?
2016-04-05 11:43:30	nkaretnikov`	clever: ah
2016-04-05 11:43:46	nkaretnikov`	clever: but i want to configure per user
2016-04-05 11:43:50	nkaretnikov`	that's global, right?
2016-04-05 11:43:51	nkaretnikov`	or not?
2016-04-05 11:44:01	clever	the first 2 paths, are relative to a users home dir
2016-04-05 11:44:11	clever	the 3rd path puts the username in %u
2016-04-05 11:44:27	clever	and http://nixpaste.lbr.uno/wn-jw-ZA?nix configures nixos to auto-generate /etc/ssh/authorized_keys.d/clever
2016-04-05 11:44:43	nkaretnikov`	clever: neat
2016-04-05 11:44:51	nkaretnikov`	clever: thanks so much, gonna try that
2016-04-05 11:44:58	nkaretnikov`	not sure how i missed it
2016-04-05 11:45:05	clever	i keep all of my keys in a keys.nix, which i import near the top of my config
2016-04-05 11:45:15	clever	and they are in a tree, based on hostname and username
2016-04-05 11:45:35	clever	so i can just name which keys i want to allow, and dont have to keep track of the giant strings
2016-04-05 11:46:02	nkaretnikov`	clever: i rely on a huge let block with hardcoded strings at the moment
2016-04-05 11:46:07	nkaretnikov`	but i got your point
2016-04-05 11:46:19	clever	  keys = import ./keys.nix;
2016-04-05 11:46:23	clever	i just have this in the let block
2016-04-05 11:46:27	nkaretnikov`	yeah, i'm aware
2016-04-05 11:46:35	nkaretnikov`	anyway, i have to go now

2016-04-05 11:59:27	hyper_ch	looks like I found a bug :)
2016-04-05 11:59:35	clever	mog: you could make a default.nix within that tar, that imports <nixpkgs> and then uses that stdenv to create new packages

2016-04-05 20:39:37	clever	brandonz: simplest solution i thought of, is to manualy cross-compile a aarch64 kernel, and boot an armv7l userland under that (one already containing nixos would be best)
2016-04-05 20:40:07	clever	then convince nix that it can run aarch64 binaries (https://github.com/cleverca22/nix-misc/blob/master/upgrade.patch) and set it loose on the new bootstrap

2016-04-06 06:00:28	mijarena	so i tried to boot the liveimage via grub2, to install it into chroot and some other tricks i found in the manual
2016-04-06 06:01:13	mijarena	but nothing worked quit right. so: somehow i have to install it out of a runnig system, either by booting it virtually or by other means

2016-04-06 06:03:46	goibhniu	there is a thing called nixos-assimilate for exactly this, but I don't think it's finished yet

2016-04-06 06:35:53	manveru	so ineed, glib depends on python :(
2016-04-06 06:35:56	manveru	*indeed
2016-04-06 06:36:39	manveru	and for some unknown reason, that dependency makes its way into my docker container...
2016-04-06 06:37:14	manveru	or maybe i'm missing something
2016-04-06 06:37:24	kostja	the system to build texlive packages does not provide each contained module as a package. this is a bad thing, since 1) you can not query for texlive modules and 2) you can not build a nix expression, depending on a texlive module

2016-04-06 06:43:18	zimbatm	how do you know it's a dependency of glib ?

2016-04-06 06:44:25	manveru	problem is just, it's only a nativeBuildInput of glib, so it shouldn't be propagated
2016-04-06 06:44:28	__Sander__	heh that's funny
2016-04-06 06:44:33	manveru	so this must be caused by soemthing ellse

2016-04-06 06:45:09	zimbatm	manveru: yeah probably
2016-04-06 06:45:35	manveru	this seems to be the derivation that builds the image, not the derivation of the image itself

2016-04-06 06:48:16	manveru	the container ends up being around 100MB
2016-04-06 06:48:17	zimbatm	do you have access to the inner store ?
2016-04-06 06:48:22	manveru	yeah
2016-04-06 06:48:28	zimbatm	can you run nix-store in it ?

2016-04-06 08:28:08	gilligan_	Is there some way to garbage collect /nix/store/*-my-package such that nix-store will clean up in the correct order etc ? I run nix-build in my ci pipeline and want to garbage collect the packages at some point
2016-04-06 08:28:57	simpson	gilligan_: What do you mean by "correct order"? Why would there be some order to packages?
2016-04-06 08:30:00	FossiWebchat	joachifm: but perl wants to read /root/.nix-profile (which "accidentialy" is a symlink to something else)

2016-04-06 08:30:39	FossiWebchat	the location it is pointing to is of course readable, but it doesn't even get that far
2016-04-06 08:31:35	gilligan_	simpson, right.. let me elaborate.. in fact there is foo foo-sub1 foo-sub2  - and I think if I just do `nix-store --delete /nix/store/*foo` it will try to remove those packages in *some* order disregarding dependencies
2016-04-06 08:31:37	FossiWebchat	so, when i install perl with nix-env -i as root, something makes it want to read from /root/.nix-profile

2016-04-06 08:32:06	gilligan_	simpson, so foo depends on foo-sub1 and foo-sub2
2016-04-06 08:32:10	gilligan_	simpson, am I making any sense? :)
2016-04-06 08:32:17	jophish	And because of this (I think) the programs looks a little retro, and doesn't fit with the rest of the theme on the system
2016-04-06 08:32:22	jophish	what can be done about this?
2016-04-06 08:32:27	simpson	gilligan_: Why can't you just run nix-collect-garbage?
2016-04-06 08:33:16	gilligan_	simpson, sure..that works.. but it will most certainly remove more than I want
2016-04-06 08:33:41	simpson	gilligan_: If you want to preserve something, you need to preserve the GC root. nix-build makes GC roots for you. Are you not keeping them around?
2016-04-06 08:34:16	gilligan_	simpson, you lost me at `GC roots`
2016-04-06 08:34:56	dash	gilligan_: well, what do you want to keep? :)
2016-04-06 08:35:41	simpson	gilligan_: I am happy to explain. Nix's GC figures out what should be kept by tracking so-called "roots", which are pointers into the Nix store that indicate that a package is in use.

2016-04-06 09:38:06	copumpkin	it would be a bit friendlier to virtualized environments
2016-04-06 09:38:17	nahamu	Lethalman: where does that code live?
2016-04-06 09:38:40	Lethalman	copumpkin, no specific reason I believe
2016-04-06 09:38:46	Lethalman	nahamu, in nixpkgs repo
2016-04-06 09:38:47	copumpkin	cool
2016-04-06 09:38:55	copumpkin	then many instances of runInLinuxVM could be replaced by runInLinuxContainer, right?

2016-04-06 09:39:16	Lethalman	nahamu, that
2016-04-06 09:39:21	copumpkin	what would stop it?
2016-04-06 09:39:30	Lethalman	copumpkin, because the container shares the kernel of the host
2016-04-06 09:39:32	copumpkin	I thought we mostly used runInLinuxVM to do filesystem manipulation for images
2016-04-06 09:39:37	copumpkin	sure
2016-04-06 09:39:47	Lethalman	and runInLinuxVM is necessary for testing the kernel
2016-04-06 09:39:49	copumpkin	but it's in a different namespace, and I thought the main appeal of it was to be able to mount
2016-04-06 09:40:00	copumpkin	Lethalman: I'm not talking about the VM test framework

2016-04-06 09:40:56	Lethalman	copumpkin, the problem comes with hydra I believe
2016-04-06 09:41:08	Lethalman	but...
2016-04-06 09:41:12	Lethalman	yeah I think it should work
2016-04-06 09:41:28	copumpkin	my main issue is that I want to run Hydra on EC2 and I don't have virtualization. I'd like "VM" tests to run there too, but small steps at a time
2016-04-06 09:41:28	Lethalman	nix probably needs a flag more, like "kvm" to say the machine can run containers
2016-04-06 09:41:39	copumpkin	hydra already has a flag like that I think
2016-04-06 09:41:46	domenkozar	Yes.

2016-04-06 09:42:20	Forkk_	Is there a way to configure MIME type associations in my Nix config? Firefox has taken over as the default for everything :(
2016-04-06 09:42:27	Lethalman	copumpkin, ah the problem with containers is that you need root
2016-04-06 09:42:37	copumpkin	Lethalman: not for user namespaces
2016-04-06 09:42:51	copumpkin	although as Dezgeg says, I think those have separate concerns
2016-04-06 09:43:16	Lethalman	copumpkin, might not work for everything
2016-04-06 09:43:25	copumpkin	i.e., you can combine any of the other namespaces with user namespaces, and get any namespace without root
2016-04-06 09:43:27	Lethalman	if you need to do a "su" command inside the vm, you must do it
2016-04-06 09:43:46	Lethalman	so replacing runInLinuxVM with non-root containers is not an option for docker image building
2016-04-06 09:43:47	copumpkin	no, the inside of the container can happily think it's root
2016-04-06 09:43:50	copumpkin	you can supply a mapping
2016-04-06 09:43:51	Lethalman	but certainly an alternative

2016-04-06 09:44:35	copumpkin	yeah, I agree
2016-04-06 09:44:41	copumpkin	but I think a lot of what we use it for would just work
2016-04-06 09:44:51	copumpkin	assuming people trust user namespaces, which is a big assumption :)
2016-04-06 09:44:52	Lethalman	yeah for your use cases it might work
2016-04-06 09:45:12	Lethalman	another reason is that you may be building images with a kernel that doesn't yet support overlayfs

2016-04-06 09:45:32	mobiusjava	Is it possible to use an import file that is created by a module? I have a module that needs to create the extraUsers from a curl call, and then have that file (say users.nix) into /etc/nixos/configuration.nix.
2016-04-06 09:45:47	copumpkin	I mostly just want the Nix ecosystem to be friendlier to environments without virtualization :)
2016-04-06 09:46:01	Lethalman	copumpkin, I think the best step should be to use libvirt
2016-04-06 09:46:05	copumpkin	yeah
2016-04-06 09:46:11	copumpkin	I want to do that for the VM test stuff

2016-04-06 09:47:35	copumpkin	I might start with a very simple call to unshare, etc.
2016-04-06 09:47:40	copumpkin	and then see what breaks
2016-04-06 09:47:44	Lethalman	but probably a pkgs.config wide for that is enough
2016-04-06 09:47:47	copumpkin	and then see if it's worth generalizing
2016-04-06 09:47:51	mobiusjava	avn: well, the curl call gives us a json file which then has to be converted into the users format
2016-04-06 09:48:04	copumpkin	mobiusjava: curl generally won't work inside nix builds
2016-04-06 09:48:23	copumpkin	the nix model is to have them (in theory) be offline, and adding curl into a build adds nondeterminism
2016-04-06 09:48:32	copumpkin	so any build on hydra will fail if it uses curl
2016-04-06 09:48:39	mobiusjava	ugh
2016-04-06 09:48:52	copumpkin	on the plus side, the mechanism behind fetchurl is extensible
2016-04-06 09:48:56	copumpkin	you can write your own fetchers
2016-04-06 09:49:00	copumpkin	as long as they produce deterministic output
2016-04-06 09:49:00	Lethalman	mobiusjava, the point is that nix-build disables networking
2016-04-06 09:49:30	Lethalman	mobiusjava, if you really need that, you can tell nix to avoid using a chroot for that derivation, I believe
2016-04-06 09:49:41	Lethalman	if it's something private for your work, that might help

2016-04-06 12:44:39	icetan	i don't need to wrap it if i do nix-build
2016-04-06 12:45:06	icetan	but to get it to work with nix-env -qa i have to wrap it some how
2016-04-06 12:45:25	icetan	because it wont trigger the fetchTarball on nix-env -qa

2016-04-06 16:01:48	acowley	I know I've asked this before, but has anybody else encountered trouble with a wrapper script being used as a shebang, and, if so, what's a solution?
2016-04-06 16:02:18	acowley	I'm dealing with a tool that finds the right python, then tries to use it in a shebang. But calling it directly ends up interpreting the python script as a bash.

2016-04-07 05:52:32	jophish	well, at the moment I'm calling `python` directly, so that's tricky

2016-04-07 09:00:11	gour	atm i use debian (sid) and plan to migrate my father-in-law's machine from suse to debian, but wonder if nixos is stable enough for non-hacky user, something like debian stable which does not require much fiddling or is nixos still more suitable for tech-savvy users?
2016-04-07 09:00:57	goibhniu	Hi Guest91282, I don't really understand the question ... you can dual boot, and you can also use nix on a debian based system
2016-04-07 09:01:06	Shell	Guest91282: heavily depends on what, precisely, you're developing. it took me a few tries to "get it", really. there's general stuff, like using nix-shell to create development environments (so you have a shell.nix in your project that contains definitions for dependencies, and you run nix-shell to install them within a shell), and a bunch of languages are well-supported, but I'm still having issues with the likes of node.js.

2016-04-07 12:18:19	Lethalman	pfo, nix-shell is very simple, it just clears out env
2016-04-07 12:18:24	Lethalman	pfo, it doesn't do anything with namespaces
2016-04-07 12:18:58	pfo	so without using the daemon that uses chroot you can get bleed through from the env when not running on nixos basically?
2016-04-07 12:19:30	Lethalman	pfo, didn't understand the phrase
2016-04-07 12:19:40	pfo	it seems nix can make use of a daemon
2016-04-07 12:19:47	Lethalman	pfo, nix-shell does use the daemon to get the derivations, after that it just spawns a new shell

2016-04-07 12:29:46	Lethalman	nkaretnikov`, or use containers

2016-04-07 12:32:31	random0819	Hi. (nixos newbie here) Is there another way to specify boot.loader.grub.device , maybe through a function(?) that gets /dev/sda from /dev/disk/by-uuid/uuidhere (which is fileSystems."/".device) ?
2016-04-07 12:33:12	random0819	The concern is that, inserting another hdd makes the old one become /dev/sdb and thus nixos-rebuild would overwrite the new hdd with grub(?)
2016-04-07 12:33:23	nkaretnikov`	Lethalman: what is the root of the problem? i mean, i can imagine writing a generic service allowing to configure multiple instances, i.e., providing configuration.nix attrs for that
2016-04-07 12:33:43	nkaretnikov`	Lethalman: if i wanted to use containers, i wouldn't use nixos ;)
2016-04-07 12:34:09	dash	nkaretnikov`: why not, nixos makes it easy :)
2016-04-07 12:34:21	Lethalman	nkaretnikov`, yep it's certainly possible to do it
2016-04-07 12:34:28	Lethalman	nkaretnikov`, nobody ever implemented it
2016-04-07 12:36:46	nkaretnikov`	Lethalman: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/7475728593a49f09c4b7b959b15513aee38ab4b4/nixos/modules/services/continuous-integration/jenkins/default.nix take jenkins, for example, i could change this file to spawn multiple processes based on the attributes, no? (nevermind if i'm talking nonsense, i've never written services so far)
2016-04-07 12:37:24	Lethalman	nkaretnikov`, yes it could be possible to have a list of services of the same type ecc.
2016-04-07 12:38:27	nkaretnikov`	hm, maybe i'm really looking for containers... are there any limitations if i go that route?
2016-04-07 12:38:34	nkaretnikov`	dash: any good examples?
2016-04-07 12:39:07	Lethalman	nkaretnikov`, containers are more complex... you have to take in account more IPs, bind mounts ecc.
2016-04-07 12:39:15	Lethalman	update their system

2016-04-07 12:42:02	simpson	You can have nixops generate containers; it eases the burden a bit. It's kind of like Vagrant when used that way.

2016-04-07 13:11:35	pxc	is there any default way to switch to the environment associated with a package using nix-shell without actually building the package? like just to get the build dependencies and maybe drop into a source dir?
2016-04-07 13:11:55	pxc	I've been adding an ‘
2016-04-07 13:12:19	pxc	‘env’ attribute to my unfinished packages so I can install or switch to them with nix-env -iA pkg.env
2016-04-07 13:12:34	pxc	but the env attribute is always just
2016-04-07 13:13:12	pxc	env = buildEnv { name = "${name-env}"; paths = buildInputs ++ nativeBuildInputs ++ propagatedBuildInputs ++ nativePropagatedBuildInputs; }
2016-04-07 13:13:19	pxc	so it feels redundant
2016-04-07 13:15:31	ktosiek	pxc: nix-shell -A package

2016-04-07 13:16:04	ktosiek	that should throw you into a shell pretty similar to the build environment of `nixos.package`
2016-04-07 13:16:18	ktosiek	(or `nixpkgs.package` on non-nixos nix installs)
2016-04-07 13:17:29	pxc	ktosiek: do I have to be in the root of nixpkgs for that to work right, like with nix-build?

2016-04-07 13:18:26	ktosiek	yup
2016-04-07 13:18:30	ktosiek	no problem
