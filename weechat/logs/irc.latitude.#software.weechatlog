2016-03-29 14:49:04	patrick.callahan	@travis.woodrow: python2 _does_ have object coercion: https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#coercion-rules
2016-03-29 14:51:20	patrick.callahan	and it has the same kind of default string coercion as Java has in Object.toString(), with the __str__ function: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16413632/how-do-pythons-string-and-unicode-coercion-magic-functions-work

2016-04-05 07:58:27	patrick.callahan	so when using Gazebo, the PX4 SITL launches gzserver and gzclient separately, and it doesn't abort if gzclient fails to launch. So the Gazebo SITL works without modification on headless systems
2016-04-05 08:01:02	patrick.callahan	however, ‘the PX4 app’, as the PX4 docs like to call it, attaches to _all models_ in the SITL. There are some bug reports about this. So if you add a second model (through the ‘Insert’ tab in gzclient), it will follow the same orders as the other. So there's substantial work if we want to simulate multiple quadrotor models with a shared world
2016-04-05 08:01:49	travis.woodrow	No shared world is required
2016-04-05 08:02:00	travis.woodrow	In fact, do not want
2016-04-05 08:02:11	travis.woodrow	As we do not want to be coupled with gazebo
2016-04-05 08:02:46	travis.woodrow	Does that follow @patrick.callahan ?
2016-04-05 08:03:20	patrick.callahan	yup!
2016-04-05 08:03:52	patrick.callahan	just reporting
2016-04-05 08:04:37	patrick.callahan	it's worth noting in case in the future we want a shared world, since the fact that it will require muckery should be a deterrent
2016-04-05 08:06:04	patrick.callahan	as in, 1 tally on the chalkboard in favor of doing something else or rolling our own, etc.
2016-04-05 08:06:32	patrick.callahan	but until then we can be happy campers
2016-04-05 08:07:12	travis.woodrow	I expect simulation to be a tool we swap out at every opportunity for something better
2016-04-05 08:46:50	patrick.callahan	I've got a working docker image for spinning up new SITLs, but I've forgotten my dockerhub credentials
2016-04-05 08:46:56	patrick.callahan	I'll push it when I get in in a few minutes
2016-04-05 08:48:10	patrick.callahan	I ended up having to include the source because launching without gnumake will involve research, and launching with gnumake uses cmake which needs write access to the cmake caches
2016-04-05 08:48:22	patrick.callahan	I tried some overlay stuff but it was no good
2016-04-05 09:32:48	travis.woodrow	cool
