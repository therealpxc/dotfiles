2016-04-02 11:07:24	laurent.fough	Hello, all...
2016-04-02 11:07:36	laurent.fough	I’ve. got. a. question.
2016-04-02 11:08:33	laurent.fough	Are there any HARD rules/restrictions on plugin requirements.? I’ve gone over the contributing & plugin development docs, and haven’t seen anything, so figured I’d ask prior to getting too deep into my plugin.
2016-04-02 11:08:54	laurent.fough	1) plugin retrieves a preview of a omf-theme in the terminal.
2016-04-02 11:09:13	laurent.fough	2) plugin is _mostly_ functional on my system
2016-04-02 11:09:38	laurent.fough	3) plugin does require a node module, with its own requirements.
2016-04-02 11:26:05	bobthecow	I don't think there are any hard restrictions.
2016-04-02 11:28:10	bobthecow	Many of the plugins have dependencies. Just add instructions to the readme.
2016-04-02 11:28:25	laurent.fough	@bobthecow: Thanks for the info.
2016-04-02 11:28:31	bobthecow	e.g. thefuck, grc, etc.
2016-04-02 11:28:44	bobthecow	For things that can't be enforced by OMF, current best practice is for the plugin to assert that everything it needs is present inside its `init.fish`, and provide instructions and/or not actually initialize when a dependency is missing.
2016-04-02 11:29:17	laurent.fough	Figured I’d have to do as much— downloaded the entire plugins repo last night, to take a gander at those that do use external (to the system) tools.
2016-04-02 11:29:37	laurent.fough	Got it. Logical. and makes sense.
2016-04-02 11:30:50	bobthecow	Note that you probably shouldn't be installing things for the user. That's outside the scope of OMF and likely asking for trouble :)
2016-04-02 11:31:09	bobthecow	But telling them what they need to do is totally :+1:
2016-04-02 11:31:56	bobthecow	What's your plugin going to do?
2016-04-02 11:32:20	laurent.fough	> 1) plugin retrieves a preview of an omf-theme in the terminal.
2016-04-02 11:32:56	bobthecow	Oh, gotcha. I missed that the first time.
2016-04-02 11:33:04	laurent.fough	No worries.
2016-04-02 11:33:58	laurent.fough	I may have to limit it to only: iTerm (OSX) at the moment, and of most terms on *NIX that support inline images.
2016-04-02 11:34:53	laurent.fough	It scrapes the `repo://*Themes.md#<theme-name>` page retrieves the specific image tag and uses imgcat or other tool to display
2016-04-02 11:35:41	bobthecow	There are a handful of early projects that also support fancy stuff. Look into Black Screen as well?
2016-04-02 11:35:54	bobthecow	https://github.com/shockone/black-screen 
2016-04-02 11:40:01	laurent.fough	Yeah: actually use black-screen… impressive, but not impressed, it core compatibility with what I need do in a shell (daily) is lacking. I keep checking in, every couple of weeks, building it, then running, then… loudly sighing
2016-04-02 11:42:50	laurent.fough	There was also TermKit, a while ago… I think it may dead though.
2016-04-02 11:42:52	laurent.fough	https://github.com/unconed/TermKit 
2016-04-02 11:47:24	bobthecow	Yeah. TermKit was promising too. It'll take a while for any of these to hit their stride but I keep hoping :)
2016-04-03 19:09:35	derekstavis	Hey @coderstephen, I have been using `argu` recently and I’m stuck in an issue, I believe
2016-04-03 19:10:53	derekstavis	can I have the following CLI? `foobar -t 3 -- git status` and capture the `git status` part as a single argument?
2016-04-03 19:45:47	coderstephen	Hmm... not currently. I can add an option to do so, if you like.
2016-04-03 19:53:11	derekstavis	I’m not very used to getopts standard, so I expected everything after the `--` to be captured in a single argument
2016-04-03 19:53:30	derekstavis	I have been writing a new awesome plugin for developers :stuck_out_tongue:
2016-04-03 19:53:48	derekstavis	(In fact I have been writing it to help myself)

2016-04-04 13:00:04	pxc	hey guys
2016-04-04 13:00:33	pxc	what's the easiest way for me to simply append something to my fish prompt without changing my theme?
2016-04-04 13:01:15	pxc	I want my theme to indicate whether or not the current shell has been launched by nix-shell. It would be cool if it had an indicator like many addons have git indicators
2016-04-04 13:01:41	pxc	will the best thing ultimately be to fork my theme of choice and add it to their fish_prompt function, then make a PR?
2016-04-04 13:02:33	derekstavis	You can make a copy of original `fish_prompt` function, override it, and call the original
2016-04-04 13:03:40	pxc	so make a copy, e.g., fish_shmompt
2016-04-04 13:03:52	pxc	then have fish_prompt call fish_shmompt before adding my little piece?
2016-04-04 13:04:03	derekstavis	yes!
2016-04-04 13:04:17	derekstavis	you can copy functions using `functions -c`
2016-04-04 13:04:34	pxc	oh, rad!
2016-04-04 13:04:52	pxc	is there any word on the possibility of identifying/specifying external (non-fish) dependencies for omf plugins yet?
2016-04-04 13:05:54	derekstavis	We still don't have this ability
2016-04-04 13:06:06	pxc	ok
2016-04-04 13:06:34	derekstavis	We have been working on some other features, like versioned releases
2016-04-04 13:09:25	pxc	I saw a few bits. I'm glad development continued at a respectable pace while you guyts sorted out the takedown
2016-04-04 13:10:02	pxc	how have you been, Derek?
2016-04-04 13:16:52	derekstavis	Github have reverted the takedown. Everyone who had his fork took down earned a Github T-Shirt :stuck_out_tongue:
2016-04-04 13:18:27	derekstavis	They understood there was bad faith in the requests, now I believe we are free from this disgrace
2016-04-04 13:19:12	derekstavis	I have been great, pxc, very busy with a job transition, part time in one, part time in other
2016-04-04 13:21:26	derekstavis	How were you in this meantime? Much nixOS fun? :stuck_out_tongue:
2016-04-04 13:55:35	pxc	yeah! I've been doing a bunch of NixOS stuff
2016-04-04 13:56:12	pxc	that job transition sounds tricky
2016-04-04 13:56:16	pxc	are your employers aware of each other?
2016-04-04 13:56:18	pxc	lol
2016-04-04 13:59:01	derekstavis	yeah, they are, it was an agreement
2016-04-04 14:00:09	derekstavis	the new company needed my help ASAP and I the old company needed time to find someone to replace my position
2016-04-04 14:00:52	derekstavis	so instead of 30 days (which is enforced by the law) I will perform a part-time 60 day
2016-04-04 14:03:41	pxc	ah, that's pretty cool
2016-04-04 14:04:21	pxc	right now I'm actually doing Nix stuff, configuring a development and testing environment for work. I dropped by because I'm trying to figure out if it's time to add a nice fancy fish to the dev env

2016-04-05 06:58:53	derekstavis	Yeah, it's a good thing.
2016-04-05 07:11:13	coderstephen	I saw that earlier and was confused ...
2016-04-05 07:13:16	derekstavis	I still don't understand how it works
2016-04-05 07:13:20	nesl247	I’d just stick to OMF or Fundle. Would rather not have my shell’s package manager in another language.
2016-04-05 07:13:31	derekstavis	And as I've done with Fisherman, I have no interest in running it
2016-04-05 07:14:35	derekstavis	Also about the benefits,  "adding a single file to config.fish" isn't that much benefit
2016-04-05 07:14:47	nesl247	Complete opposite benefit in my opinion.
2016-04-05 07:14:56	nesl247	I prefer to keep as much config for my shell in the one file.
2016-04-05 07:16:03	derekstavis	Also, I don't understand why framework creators can't see that much of the loading time is because of plugins, not infrastructure
2016-04-05 07:16:40	derekstavis	Currently OMF startup process is slow, but `better-init` branch solves most issues while keeping (and improving) compatibility
2016-04-05 07:17:40	nesl247	That chips thing basically works by parsing a yaml file of git urls and executes init.fish in each repo.
2016-04-05 07:18:03	nesl247	The line in the config.fish file is probably to simply run the chips binary
2016-04-05 07:18:26	derekstavis	Yeah. And then we continue with the same issue: Plugin's `init.fish`
2016-04-05 07:19:17	nesl247	Yeah, the whole project makes very little sense to me. Who cares if the plugin manager is 500ms faster or whatever. How often do you actually run it anyways?
2016-04-05 07:19:49	derekstavis	Whoa, 500ms faster is meaningful to me :stuck_out_tongue:
2016-04-05 07:19:59	nesl247	Lol, it was a hyperbole
2016-04-05 07:20:13	derekstavis	Yeah, I see, just kidding
2016-04-05 07:20:25	nesl247	If OMF was that slow, you guys would have people banging on your door
2016-04-05 07:20:44	derekstavis	We have a single people banging on our door...
2016-04-05 07:21:48	nesl247	That halloween song is now popping into my head.. Who can it be now?
2016-04-05 07:22:25	nesl247	Well, at least halloween in the sense that there was a halloween door knocker that kept singing it that I had growing up
2016-04-05 07:23:20	derekstavis	Haha, I'm sure he is watching our talk right now (or while he's awake).
2016-04-05 07:23:42	derekstavis	OMF slowness is not a issue for him, it's a market point
2016-04-05 07:25:05	nesl247	At least a good thing came of the whole debacle. GitHub is more likely to protect OMF against other would-be asshats.
2016-04-05 07:25:55	derekstavis	Surely, I expect Github to give more attention to perjurious DMCA requests
